Sorry for being a fucking amazing drunk person.
Also I felt like may be I was cock blocking Dante. I do apologise.
A little morbid no?".
That was beautiful. Merry Christmas you albino stallion and thanks for the fantastic year. All (we) the best.
Hi sue it's Adrian.
Hi Hellen it's Adrian.
Thank you, good to hear you liked it! Something might have gone wrong when I converted it from Mac to Windows, I'll try and sort it out.
No problem. If there's anymore you find today just send them over again.
Ok. Nonna just called. Back from dromana now.
Ok.
It comes out at 2 doesn't it? I haven't checked.
Yup there it is.
You get what you wanted ?
👏yay!
My first pref too. Communication design at rmit.
What were you doing again?
Computer science?
Nice.
Hey so did you get into The course you wanted?
I thought they came out at 2 today but I was wrong. Check your emails.
Well I got mine, Adam got his, plenty of people on Facebook have posted where they're going.
!!! Congrats!
Yep. Communication design at rmit.
Monash for you yes? Medicine?
Ooh fancy haha.
Thanks briggi!!! Hope you have a great day and see you soon.
Thank you Nat! Have a great day also and congratulations on your netball achievements.  We're all so proud of you!!
Thank you zio Frank! Hope you have a great day and we look forward to seeing you all soon.
Hello.
I'm sure we would. I should be able to, what night is it?
Also I saw your post on Facebook, congrats on getting into Monash.
Right right of course.
Do you prefer that course? Yeah I got what I wanted, but I had known for a little while that I'd get it. Bc it was a folio they sent an email to say that they'd accept me, so that i would know for preferences and all that.
Hahah melancholy I think doc loc would describe it. As yeah it was a bit, like oh ok yeah that all checks out.
Btw do you ever find out your umat score.
Haven't I spoken about it enough in Italian hahah. It's Communication Design at rmit. Which is print, digital, advertising, branding etc etc.
Nah me either.
Your sarcasm is much appreciated.
Yeah yeah I know I was just joking.
Looks like they got a few too many recruits today.
Yeah I got up soon after you left.
how does that work? would it be like one long music video?
but when is it?
Yeah sure why not.
why so early in the morning though haha.
oh yeah probably.
Oh so he's going to be performing the album. Hopefully we'll get one of his auto tuned rants in the middle of one of his songs.
that should still be fine.
Yeah I don't mind.
Hey you didn't buy tickets to that Laneway festival that grimes was playing at did you?
No.
I forgot all about it but it turns out they sold out a couple days ago.
I was just worried that you'd already bought them expecting me to go too.
All well.
Yeah they were expensive.
Oh yeah the room.
That's the sixth right?
I'll have to ask.
About what time? It would be fine whenever though.
Yeah that would be fine I think.
Just asked. It's all g.
Impressive.
Ok.
Hey Nat, saw the photos you sent us. Just wanted to say thanks, we'll definitely use some of them in the book!
Speak soon, Adrian.
Awesome!
Hey briggie! How did your first day of yr12 go? Hope it went well and good luck for the rest of the week!
Hope they didn't give you too much for the first day! See you guys Sunday.
Yeah we're almost finishing up.
On tram now.
No I took a pair.
Ok sure.
Daniel sent me this. No more context is needed.
That right there is quality 2000s entertainment.
Actually I haven't thought about it. Probably a dress shirt. Nothing like a suit or anything haha.
Yeah sounds suitable.
Depends what kind. If it's a thinish, plain one it would probably be fine. Wouldn't go with anything that Roland or Dady would wear though haha.
Shit sandy soz. That looks a little fucked up...
But yeah that tie would work I think.
You too!
Depends where we meet, but probably tram.
Well it goes past flinders st.
But the tram goes down Lygon st anyway.
That should be fine.
Sorry we were out just got back now. I've still got to get ready and everything but I'll message when I leave.
Are you going to eat somewhere there or should I eat beforehand?
Weird qs I know but that's my parents for ya.
I'll message when I'm leaving. It should only take me 30 mins to get to Lyon st.
I was under the impression that we were meeting at 8 until 3 mins ago haha.
Ok.
Well that's just what I was told today.
Adam. This morning he said we were meeting at 8.
Anyway it doesn't matter.
On the way to tram now.
Are you able to pick me up I don't think the trams coming.
I'm heading back.
Look this tram isn't coming. I'm going to see if my dad will be able to drive me so I might be a bit late.
Er than I already am.
Outside the cinema would be easier to find.
But maybe decide where you want to eat while you wait.
Ok I'm 5-10 mins away.
I here.
Movies done. Can you come pick me up on Swanson st outside the uni lodge.
Faraday.
It's near the Melb Uni tram stop.
I think you just passed me.
On tram now.
You going to actually show up today or just nah.
The room did lack a certain irrelevant wit in all honesty.
Oh, well its goodies hear that you're feeling better now.
*its good.
Goodies is defiantly not a phrase I use.
On tram.
Yup what the problem?
Yeah he should've handed it out in the first lesson, you may not have done it in class though.
I'll see if I can send mine though.
K no worries.
Ok.
Hey Kate, just clarifying re the specialist task. How did you present your story? Was it just a one page document, did you include diagrams/screenshots?
Oh ok thanks.
It's tough.
Oh no more trees.
I mean they're lovely trees but Everything about this environment is putting me to sleep.
This lectures never going to end he's just going to keep showing us British men narrating conceptual art.
God is dead. Sophie Calle killed him.
You know in a way we're brining this upon ourselves there's nothing stopping us from leaving this room.
Aside from like manners.
Even his dvd drive was asleep lol.
Oh my g the lights it's finally over.
Not sure if Sophia's mentioned it but there's free food at uni tomorrow that you should probably know about.
Dot think I can make the 11:00 one, but I should be able to go to the later one.
Don't think^.
I'm done here.
Hey did you go to the food thing?
Coming home now, don't have a key.
Yeah ok, I'm near Moreland road at the moment.
Haha yeah it will. I ended up missing it as well.
Leslie knope would be disappointed.
Maybe, depends if anyone else is going.
I know Sophia's going to be there after 9, but I don't even know if it's  going till that late.
Yeah that too.
Yeah no clue on this end either.
I might ask Kate and Tristan if they were going to go.
Ok so neither Tristan or Kate are going.
Tbh I don't really feel like it either, kind of just want to hibernate for a bit lol.
If you want to I'm happy to go though but like if neither of us can be bothered let's not force this.
Looking forward to it.
Poggi was telling me that it's not a party or anything, Luke gets free shit if he gets at least 100 to come, and if you're on his list you get cheaper entry.
No what I mean is that there should be list at the door which includes everyone invited in the Facebook event, regardless of you go or not.
(I think)
I'm asking Poggi to be sure though bc I actually have no clue how these things work.
Wow that was a wild ride from start to finish.
I mean congrats for helping the less fortunate and everything.
Maybe it's time for a rebrand.
New year new you?
Oh man, was it a lot? Is there now a small village in Kenya with 20/20 vision?
Just take out another bank loan it'll be fine.
The surprises never end.
So what you're saying is that he forsaw how shit his album was going to be and decided not to change it?
Jk no I haven't heard about becky, I was too caught up in the story behind the Ezra and YYYs credit.
Eh go ahead.
Well it would explain his beef with her I guess.
Well, I don't think I can argue with any of that. Has anyone else caught on yet?
Because you might just have an exclusive buzzfeed listicle on your hands buster.
No tumblr would be too small. The New York Times would Be very interested im sure.
All that's missing is the x files theme.
What would you call it?
I just missed it. The next ones not for another 17 mins I don't know what I should do.
Ido come home could you drop me to Harding st and i can catch that one ?
Sorry if I catch the Sydney road one.
Why what are you wearing?
Yeah maybe not the fancy shoes. Well at least it isn't drug dealer.
Also I'm going to be a bit late.
Acording to tram tracker it says 10:50.
Yeah sorry about that.
On the tram.
Daniels coming home with me his brothers coming to pick him up.
Hey John, have a happy Easter today! Hope uni and everything is going well also!
I've been good thanks, it's all been going well so far. How've you found everything?
That's good to hear! Comm design's been great, fairly interesting aside from the occasional dull lecture (we had one last week where some guy just spoke about his paintings the whole time)
Yeah I know haha. Hoping it doesn't happen too many more times lol...
Hey Ella it's Adrian. This is the message we're going to send everyone on tumblr:
Hey! As Andy mentioned, we're compiling a book with everyone's questions about design from the first brief. Please fill out the form at the link below ASAP (ie before Wednesday) if you'd like your question included.
 (to view and fill out the form you must be signed in to your RMIT Google account)
Are you able to access the group folder Tristan set up? The tumblr list should be there. Otherwise I'll send you a link.
All g then!
Have a nice night pestering people and I'll see you Wednesday then.
Yep she was fine.
We've sorted out the times for the meetings this week. Tomorrow it'll be from 11 to 1pm. Friday will be at the same time as well.
We'll meet everyone by the red couches again, and then find a free space.
Hey dad, what's The name of Paris's ad agency (we went to Sth with him in Adelaide)
We need to interview someone for uni and I thigh by he might be a good idea.
Do you know his last name?
Sorry, thanks anyway.
Thanks!
Oh, sorry to hear that. That's fine though, Friday's prob the more important one anyway.
You'll be there for image and identity yeah? We can go over what happened at the meeting.
No worries!
Also don't forget he Kanye zine. Like that's what's most important rn.
STOP.
I'm staying a little while for another meeting.
Don't worry I'll just take the tram home.
Ok.
No leave the food please.
Hey Ella, hope I'm not bugging you. Sorry that today's meetings dragged on. We're hoping to have another one (another one!!) tomorrow 12-1. Want to try and lock down the type stuff.
Totally cool if you can't make it, but the more opinions the better/more democratic.
That's fine, it's prob a bit too last minute for most people.
You still alright for Friday?
Alright great! If anything comes out of this meeting I'll tell everyone who didn't go at the lecture.
David is def a goth.
Maybe more a reformed goth.
He was really upset when nobody in class recognised his goth heros.
I mean I did but I'm not going to admit that to him.
Eh British post-punk is close enough to goth I guess.
That is definitely a plausible possibility.
Hey, about the design book. I've been feeling that not everyone has been able to contribute as much as they'd like to, I feel that the large group sizes doesn't really give everyone a fair voice. I was thinking we set up smaller groups focused on individual aspects to help speed things up and give people more opportunities to help. I've asked the others on fb, but what do you think about it?
The groups could be something like:
- Organisation and editing qs.
- cover.
- identity / marketing.
- qs page layout.
- non qs pages (list of names, introductions etc)
We'll sort it out tomorrow but I wanted to give you a heads up.
Hey zio Frank, happy 45th birthday today! Hope you have a great day and I'll see you tomorrow!
He's still not here yet.
I sent him a text, should I still call?
Could I call him later I don't really want to make a call on the tram.
New James Blake 😍 my life is now complete.
￼￼If this explains how it works.
New radiohead tomorrow as well, I can't deal with all this good music in such a short amount of time.
I'll try.
Haha. A similar thing happened to me, my phone was glitching the fuck up at one point, I was thinking 'damn this is some experimental shit'.
Did you hear his contributions to the Beyonce album? Those chords man, those chords...
Not sure if I've emailed this out already, but there's going to be another meeting tomorrow after colour and info. See you there hopefully.
Today is a good day.
Do you even have a vinyl player???
Unfortunately it's not on Spotify rn so I'm going to have to buy it when I get back 😥.
Oh right yeah of course.
Yeah I heard that too. Was a little surprised the singles were on it tbh considering their history.
No it's fine thanks though, I'll buy it either off the site or iTunes tonight.
Or like, in class.
I couldn't listen to them on my phone anyway.
Stop class and just have a listening party.
I'll be doing them all a favour.
U ok.
Hey is your leg ok now? Sorry about earlier was in the middle of our meeting.
How do you feel about Andy's idea?
Most of the others are a bit ehh on the idea of using emojis, but what do you think?
Yeah, look I wouldn't be comfortable using it on something people are paying for.
Yeah just hide it somewhere haha.
Anyway we'll see what happens.
Good to hear.
Well not good but you know.
Only once unfortunately, but I'm liking it so far.
It's not anything radically different, which I like.
Just a good mix of the sounds they've picked up over time.
This morning, when I didn't have the new album to listen to on the tram, I had a listen to the live version.
Hmm piano or guitar... Not sure really. The live one was more "conventional" and so I guess it felt more direct. Over time I'd probably prefer the new one.
Just because there's more going on maybe??
Wbu?
Yeah I understand why you would, whenever there's a song I love and then I hear a live version that's even only slightly different, it bug me. Which is kind of dumb I guess.
No I haven't heard that one so I can't really compare it. Reminds me of In Rainbows a little bit.
Yooo they want to have another meeting tomorrow from 1:30 to 3:30. I know you don't have classes, it's up to you if you want to come or not. They'll be figuring out the design etc if you're interested.
Just checking that you got the previous message this time😜.
Sure no worries!
I literally just heard an ad for Papa Rich on the radio.
Apparently it's a Malaysian restaurant?
I'm down to pay him a visit.
You know, I think you might be onto something.
Yeah yeah.
Yes omg forest fire.
Yeah I've been listening to it on repeat the last couple of days. I've been really liking it.
Had to squeeze a good listen in before radiohead dropped.
I think it feels more developed, artistically or whatever. Broader in style too maybe?
I think I prefer it over the other two.
I'm not sure why, I just found this one to be stronger emotionally perhaps.
Yooo we're organising another meeting for tomorrow from 11:30 to 1:30. Be great if you could come, andy wants to try and smash out the book (or at least as much as possible) because we'll probably take orders tomorrow in the lecture.
Cool!
I'm still here. Keep my food though!!
Almost home.
￼After 5 years the bastards finally caught up with me.
No clue.
I was planning on getting CC eventually so I guess nows a good time.
Oh wow that? That's some proxy app I downloaded once and forgot to uninstall. It's supposed to be a lantern but the yellow's too light.
I never noticed that it does look like that though haha.
No. But maybe we'll see what happens in the near future.
Yooo just emailed you that brief.
Now I actually have to go and start it rn.
Ugh all the words why does he have to over explain everything.
Nah me either I usually just guess what he wants us to do. Ask a few people, go with whoever seems least confused.
"""Research""" w this one though lol.
Clause after dependant clause. This is starting to read like one of my literature essays.
No that column is usually blocked out by my bs detectors.
Though they must need retuning bc the whole page should be white.
Designer as investigator.
If you need a palate cleanser I'll send you that image from today.
👍🏼.
Gotta have that flava.
Yep I'm fine.
No we ate here. Coming home now.
Um ok sure.
So Anthony just messaged me. Apparently he's got some new discount card so can you please not use his old one?
No worries.
How ya been anyway.
Look idk what any of that means I'm just relaying it.
And yeah. But I'm his only contact point to you I guess?
Well besides John, janzen, and literally everyone else from parade.
In a good way or bad?
Eh. But thanks anyway.
...
Yeah sure it's been pretty good.
Sorry that's a fair amount of information to digest at once.
Why did you drop out of uni?
Oh ok, fair enough I guess.
Yeah I saw that actually I though it was some joke.
Probs yeah.
You feeling ok over your relationship? (sorry I'm still working down the list of things)
Yeah I guess, you don't want it to be weird or anything.
Yeah I can imagine that would be quite difficult.
Withdrawal symptoms lol.
￼It's not confirmed yet but once I find out I'll let you know for sure.
No worries.
It's actually been quite nice, thanks for asking!
Haven't done much besides go to a faux-Melbourne restaurant and walk around their riverside thing.
How was not having David's afternoon lecture?
Oh yeah tumblr...
How's that coming along?
Well thing is, he said a few times that you can do a few really good in depth posts and get the same mark as someone who may have done heaps of shorter ones.
So idk maybe you can get an HD with less than 100 posts.
But I'm guessing he'll be pretty stingy with the HDs.
I think it should be ok, I've been forcing myself to write and research stuff for a little while now. My reblogs aren't that great though.
So this week I was going through my likes and adding some 'insight'.
What about the next assignment? 😬.
Oh no I meant the last comm design one.
I haven't even begun thinking about I&I...
Yeah same here unfortunately.
Well this ones prob a write off, but David Lynch 😄.
Ikr, like he would never do it, but imagine...
Yours?
Oh that would have been awesome! And yeah defiantly, that's like the worse thing about being successful lol.
The other person I contacted was the musician St Vincent, but again I had to send it to her management.
🙌 she's brilliant isn't she.
Speaking of great music, the new James Blake album? 👌🏼👌🏼💯💯.
The collab with Bon Iver - so good.
How's that Tarantino costume going btw?
Impressive! Hope it all comes together then.
That meetings going ahead btw.
Hi Silvia, Adrian here.
Would I be able to come past this coming week to do that q&a project for uni I mentioned the other day? Which days would be best for you?
Yeah Thursday mornings good!
Otherwise could sometime Tuesday work? It's just it would give me a few more days afterwards to continue working on it.
Yeah cool that would be great! Thank you so much.
I also though it would be a nice idea to take some photos of your studio or perhaps the cafe, but we can figure that out at a later date (the interviews the most important part)
I there any Panadol? I've got a bit of a head ache.
Thank you.
They play more lana del  Ray than I'm comfortable with in Brisbane.
Sure do, all those bad memories...
...of listening to LDR.
🔥🔥🔥.
We had a bit of a run in with the local cartel. Not good. Lost a couple of fratelli.
I was alright of course, had my bulletproof 3 piece suite.
Grazie.
That was some A+ quality content right there 💯💯👌🏼👍🏼.
Going to take a few more views to truly unpack what the fuck is going on.
Hey, I was going to have another meeting tomorrow after colour and info until 2:30.
We're going to figure out how we'll take orders and market the book. Be great if you could make it.
When was it again?
There's been an accident. Tram not coming for a while. Can you drop me off at Sydney road?
Haha yeah I don't see you in class. Still recovering from the Tarantino ball 😉.
No worries, if anything happens I'll let you know.
Hey mum I was just wondering if we've got some kind of money box that locks. We need one to store the money from the book orders.
Or some kind of box that locks, or a small safe.
Still in city. Will go past and get it. Thanks.
We just discussed how we'd be collecting orders at tomorrow's workshop. We'd also have to take orders at the lectures bc Andy didn't mention the book this morning.
We also spoke about how we might go with marketing/planning the event. Nothing major/too expensive.
Hi Silvia, is everything still alright for me to call you at 1 for that interview?
Sorry Katherine's being a dick.
No worries.
It's ok, I think most of the others are running late too 😄.
Yeah literally no one else is here yet 😅.
Hi Silvia, is it still ok for me to come past at 11 to your house?
Tristan: 0431487775.
Sofia: 0439668080.
Hey, did you get home alright?
Yooo, has Tristan snapped yet?
That one photo sums up the relationship you two have.
Good to hear though 👍🏼.
See you tomorrow.
Good to hear!
Finally! I'll see if I can come past soon to rescue my stuff.
Also:
"Chased by cops, Blaze (Nic Cage) rides up the arch of the Southbank Pedestrian Footbridge, which connects Southbank to Flinders Street station, before he plunges into the Yarra River.".
I've got to go past rmit soon so I might not be home.
How long you going to nap for?
It might take about 45 mins for me to get there? Up to you.
Yo I'm here, wake up.
By the elevators that smell like bad Chinese food.
What was your apartment number?
K thanks I'll be up in a min.
Yeah that would be alright.
He's always ready for a good time.
Hey what was the name of that New Zealand film you mentioned last night at sexy pizza?
Planned on asking earlier but like I forgot.
Oh yeah I've heard of that, that came out last year. Didn't see it though.
The more you look into Silvio the more you wonder how it was possible that he was allowed run a 1st world country.
See what I mean the mans a living meme.
Did George Clooney go see the bed?
Was it every thing you imagine a bed from Putin to be??
Wow.
Good on Clooney for keeping his integrity though. Silvio's all like, fuck saving Darfur, let's spend our foreign aid on prostitution!!
Of course he's best friends with a middle eastern dictator, why wouldn't he be.
Do you reckon Putin has a bed from him?
Like is that a thing world leaders do, give each other beds????
What other home furnishings does he have? A credenza from Kim Jon-Un? A closet from Assad? A bedside lamp from Tony Abbott???
Oh man that pig head story, I almost forgot about that.
Sometimes I have to remind myself that that wasn't satire.
Oh yeah tru, the same thing happened in that show.
Wild, fucking wild times we're living in.
You make me sound so disappointed about all this, but I'm loving all of it!
Wouldn't have it any other way.
Like you'd be any different.
Running the world? Pft, Bunga Bunga time 🎉🎉.
Tru it would.
I'm at home now, I'll use the ikea bag for now then maybe during the holidays I can have a look. Or sometime next week.
Ok.
No I don't really like that one.
That ones ok I guess.
Hey, Adam's asked me if I'd like to go see a concert on June 1. We don't have anything on do we?
Ok cool.
Whoops, I haven't replied have I! Sorry about that (too many assignments all due at the same time is my 'excuse')
Anyway, I'm happy to come to OPN if it's not too late.
😬yeah I kind of forgot about it, sorry.
I doubt it will sell out that quickly though.
Be nice to see Yoon again though if he comes.
Hey did you get any orders this morning? Can I grab the order book off of you if so?
Yeah I may as well, you outside?
Jun 1 yeah?
Yes, totes adorbs.
Hey, thanks heaps for helping again today (even if no one bought a copy, their loss!)
Also I noticed that the Virgin Suicides is playing at the cinemas next week, would you like to go see it? There's two times, one on Monday at 2, and Tuesday at 6.30. Up to you, no pressure 😄!
Ok great! I'll send the details a little later.
Hey you doing anything after your specialist class?
Or did you not even show up to uni today 😉.
Or sleeping?
Well I mean you probably needed it.
Look, even if you went you wouldn't know what you're doing so don't stress.
Yeah, only three other people here though everyone else's left lol.
Oh yeah def 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼.
You want to grab a coffee or something soon? This class is too chill I'm falling asleep.
Nah no worries.
Still got to do papa rich though sometime.
Def def.
Hey that exhibition Bronwyn mentioned is on tonight, were you thinking of going?
Tristan said he'll probably come along as well.
Ah right yeah I should have just assumed that,.
You have fun too madly rushing this assignment then.
Don't we all.
Oh yeah trying something for the first time at the last minute that's my kind of idea of fun!
What format are you doing btw, book, poster ?
Then I'll let you go back to procrastinating.
Never too late to do a 180 I gues.
Or a complete 360.
Or you could just pull a contemporary art dick move and present your message conversation as a series of screen shots.
With some barely legible subtext abt "society" or whatever.
Hey it worked for weiwei.
Baby formula anyone?
Yeah yeah same here.
Anyway I'll stop pestering you now.
Yeah almost.
I think so, still have to confirm.
Ok sure thing.
Is Sophia at a friends house?
Oh ok cool.
Almost there.
No but in all seriousness we should do something these holidays. Anyway, have a good night! I'll see you Thursday at David's exhibition.
We are actually, to Bali, but not until the high school/primary school holidays. Yourself?
Yeah immediate family sorry.
Oh wow that sounds amazing! When is that?
Ok cool, well we can organise something after all the assignments are done and I'm less frazzled haha.
I'll be at Normanby avenue in about 10 mins.
Ehh, well it is true I guess.
It was a really short exhibition Haha.
Hey, just trying to figure out times and that for the movie on Monday.
If we catch the train from Melb central it's only about 8 mins, then the cinemas a short walk away.
I was thinking we could meet near QV at around 1:10/15 and then catch the train at 1:27/1:37. Does that sound alright and work for you?
Great 👍.
Cool, sure thing.
Whereabouts are you?
On my way home.
Yooo thanks for coming along today, I had a really great time 😊.
This is that French zombie show I mentioned, if you're looking for something besides anime and Korean telenovelas.
I'm pretty sure it's on American or UK Netflix, there is a (most likely) shitty American remake so make sure it's not that one😉.
Nw.
Hey I checked that AGDA lecture, and um it's actually next week (June 8: book order day!) not this Wednesday haha. Woops.
Yeah idk what happened there, I'll see you Thursday then, at the exhibition?
👍.
So turns out hot glue doesn't seal cork 👌well done me.
And I find this out as I place my bottles in the submissions crate.
Ikr, and I actually didn't mind how it turned out in the end, but then I had to go and fill it with water didn't i.
I've no clue. It's just David and chris chillin in a classroom, twu didn't seem like they were in a hurry to leave when I went past 3 secs ago though.
Where about are you rn?
Oh nice nice.
So you're on campus at least👍.
I'll come past and we can wallow in each others misery.
Nothing beats it.
Oh I was just going to ask you, yep sure that sounds good.
Did Brandon decide to come along?
That is true. I've got your money dw though.
So I'm early for once in my life, you almost here?
Np.
Ok so the guy we're actually seeing doesn't start until 10:00😒 I'm not sure how long he goes for, I don't want to get home too late either. I'll text when it's done and I'm on my way home.
Shows done, just waiting for a tram now.
On tram now.
Gladly.
About time, was just about to bring in the undertaker.
How did you go with your assignments?
I completely forgot to send you the type things for Niko's class sorry, I didn't really have a spare chance to 😬.
I only remembered as I was trying to fall asleep, but I assumed you had it done by then.
Oh good good. Hey that makes you ahead of me now 😅.
Well I mostly enjoyed the guy we actually went to see, but we got there at 7:40 bc it started at 8, but he had like 2 support acts with hour long sets each so his show didn't even start till 10:00.
We went in at 9 and stood through some kid's DJs set of post-Internet industrial trap whatever. His name tho, Air Max 97, such cringe.
But once 0PN actually started it was better. Wanted people to get more into the music but the most they were attempting was the odd headbob.
Googling his name it seems like the actual sneaker has 97 in the name, so it might not be his birth year (I hope not for his sake)
Well, maybe I just convinced myself that I enjoyed it, didn't even come close to beach house.
But still, apples and oranges.
Yeah maybe.
Tonight? It was just under $50, and I shouldn't really be spending that sort of money rn. But I went along mostly to appease my friend (whose become a bit of a shut in so it did him some good I hope)
They had 3 people performing so I guess that's why it was ridiculously overpriced.
Tru.
Hey have you been to the exhibition yet?
Sorry had my phone in airplane mode for battery. Too late now but I had dinner here.
Coming home now.
 I have seen the face of god and it is simpsonwave. have you seen this before?
some of these are existential af my god.
Oh yeah def this is how she perceives the world.
Gonna be hard to beat that barrel roll tit tho.
Ok I immediately have to retract that statement. The entire sentence-paragraph is gold.
Bulbous salutation my god his writing is as if a 60 year old grandma wrote fanfic in the style of stream of consciousness.
I mean, the opening paragraph of Robocop:The Novelisation was pretty tough to beat, but I reckon this tops it by a beddy-bye shut-eye.
But man that one about the abattoir? Like, I fully support vegetarianism and all, but come on.
It's a fucking roller coaster, in about 50 years people will be studying it as the greatest piece of 21st century literature ever produced.
Next hamlet I'm betting on it.
😆😆😆 I can't I literally can't handle this book, it's too much.
Short but oh so difficult to read.
I mean I can barely understand what he was saying in some of those quotes, and it doesn't help that he jams about 30 sentences into one.
I mean up until now my fav Morrissey line was "I wear black on the outside bc black is how I feel on the inside" but he's really outdone himself this time.
This is the unfiltered voice of the gods, the beating pulse of the universe reduced to a mere 118 pages, £15 rrp.
My immortal?
Morrissey the Original Goth.
Ikr, he surprised us all.
￼Hey, happy birthday today! Here’s a message from Thom and co to help you get through another year of post-millennial angst! All he best.
thats supposed to be a gif, hold on.
Well sorry to disappoint you but I found it online lol, someone else made it 😅.
But like, I trimmed it a bit so I did put some effort into it dw.
Ok, Sophia's home now.
She said no.
Heyy so I was looking up the times for Goodfellas, there's only one more day. It's Saturday at 7:30.
However I've got a one-month mass to go to at 6:30, I can't really miss it without brining shame to la famiglia.
You and Ella can still go see the movie though if you want. I could possibly leave after the mass but I reckon I'll miss at least the first hour (presuming they even let me in to the cinema). Or I could meet up with you afterwards if you were thinking of doing anything else, but srsly what would you even do lol.
Or we could go see another film of his on anther day?
There's also mean streets on Thursday I think.
But like, in an effort to educate myself in preparation, I watched it last week at home lol. But I'm up for seeing it again I guess.
The others don't really strike my fancy tbh. Dunno how I feel abt a Scorsese musical.
Or The Departed is on next Friday.
It's under a diff section, Scorsese Friday night cinema.
Have you seen Mean Streets then?
Hmm, well for me it's between Casino or the Departed. But yeah let's have her settle it.
Casinos on at 3:30, my mass is at 6:30.
Hm damn, cutting it fine.
Hmm yeah I won't be back in time damn.
Come on Scorsese why'd you have to go and make it three hours long.
Anyway yeah see what Ella decides between the other films.
Yeah I'll ask now I guess.
Hey, Kat and I were planning on going to see one of the Scorsese movies at acmi, you still able to come too?
Unfortunately I can't do Saturday (which was the only day goodfellas was playing). The others playing aren't his most notable, so we decided we'll get you to make the decision for us 😄.
Nice nice 👍👍.
And then these ones start next Friday.
Damn that's my idea of a great night.
Hey Brigette, hope your gat went well yesterday and wasn't too awful/confusing/ridiculous 😄.
Don't worry about it either way, it's pretty much useless! All the best though and we'll see you all soon!
No not yet. We're still working on the book do idk if I'll be home before the lecturer.
I probably stay here until the conference thing tonight.
Well about that, very few people showed up! But those that did enjoyed them. Not sure when it finishes though.
Hey where are you rn?
Level 5 I'll open the door.
I replied on Facebook but maybe you didn't see it?
Oh, that's a shame then. We've both seen mean streets though, and it is excellent, anyway we'll see what happens.
You still coming to the lecture tonight?
Hey are still coming to the lecture tonight? Indra tells me you're not feeling too well.
Oh well that's a shame, we're going to have to have fun without you then.
On the contrary.
It should be far easier.
Aw come on now.
Ofc there'll be a dark cloud hanging over all our heads, unable to soak in your glory of glories.
Indra wants to know when you're coming elk.
Cool cool. Yeah it's 80.
Dunno the level though.
Oh thanks!
No not yet. Almost done I think.
Coming home.
Yo so you're pretty sick atm and Ella's busy, so this movie probably isn't going to happen. All well, we can figure something else out for another time.
Hope you get well soon too, and that you know, don't die or whatever.
Sorry I lost track of time. I'll be up soon.
Yeah yeah, the exhibitions def happening (eventually)
That's comforting to hear. We've already lost so many greats this year...
I mean though if you suddenly recover and Ella's packed schedule permits it, feel free to go watch casino/goodfellas.
My being there isn't a requirement for having a good time.
Any idea when you'll be feeling better?
What do you have, a cold, the flu, leprosy?
Well people die from the flu for one thing.
But I'm pretty sure you'd know if you had the flu. Feeling feverish, throwing up, strong desire to die, that sort of thing.
Always looking on the right side of life you are.
Bright side.
Aw she flew all the from nz to check your temperature? But yeah I'm not a doctor so idk.
I mean I don't know much about pills but I'm pretty sure mixing together a bunch of unlabelled pills isn't such a great idea.
Oh good to see that at least you've still got some high level reasoning left 👍👍.
Lol so apparently a newspaper Silvio berlusconi owns was giving away free copies of Mein Kampf 😆.
Hey what about my boy Mussolini?
You feeling any better btw?
I think you just came up with silvio's reelection campaign.
And also, hey that's good to hear!
Well advertising is p close no?
Not sure if Indra's told you yet, Ella can't do Tuesday. We might try next Wednesday instead for the gallery.
Ofc.
Consigliere Kat.
K cool, hopefully it pans out 😬.
Lol thanks for telling me, I'll be careful what I say next time.
But hey, you said it yourself.
Did you want to see if we can go to the Scorsese exhibition this week then?
Depends I guess if Ella's not busy tho.
Oh I've got no idea I was mostly joking.
K so Tuesday's out, not sure if I can do Wednesday tho. Friday is all g, otherwise Thursday if you can make it.
There's the weekend ofc, but it'd be less busy during the week.
Yeah I think it was (more like 5th choice I guess)
Hey, Kat and I were hoping to go to the Scorsese exhibition later this week, are you still interested in seeing it?
We're thinking Friday atm, or maybe Thursday, but what's a good day for you?
Ok cool, I'll keep you posted then 👍.
Hey if you're free tomorrow I was thinking of going to the top designs thing (where they show last years best yr 12 folios), would you be interested in going?
It's a little last minute I know, but I've been putting it off for ages lol.
It's held at the Melb museum, so anytime between 10am-5pm.
Yeah afternoon works for me.
When's the easiest time for you?
Say around 2:00?
Should I meet you at your apartment and then we'll go from there? It's outside the cbd, near Melb Uni though.
Ok then, we can also take the tram if we need to.
So I'll come past at 2 then?
Cool cool.
Walking past emporium rn so won't be long.
In the lobby.
Maybe. Literally must've jut missed you. Coming down now.
Going to have dinner here.
Yeah on tram now.
Yoo, I still feel terrible about not paying for papa rich, I promise I'll pay you back next time 😬.
Anyway this is that music video I keep forgetting to show you .
Think of it as compensation.
Tru Ja?
ja.
How's your ankle tho?
Lol I meant "tru art ja".
But srlsy how is your ankle.
Not sure if you need it, but I asked Kate which doc she goes to, and she recommended Medical One at QV. If you bring your student card and Medicare card they give free appointments apparently.
So you’ve finally caved in and bought a turntable?
hey, so are you still all good with tomorrow? What time would you want to meet?
ofc.
and art angels to obv.
yeah maybe, though I think the crackle’s all part of the a e s t h e t i c.
or something.
👌.
Nostalgia’s the wrong word I think, I know what you mean though. it’s like vicariously experiencing nostalgia or something?
“borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered 80s” i think that’s from an LCD soundsystem song, kind of sums it up no?
sub in 80s for whatever decade you didn’t live through.
yeah, its weird.
hm i guess, just as an image then? seeing as you never played it.
just wait 10/15 more years and then everyone will be going through a 2000s phase, then we can have our nostalgia!
ah yes, floppy disks 👍👍.
hmm, might be a bit last minute for most people. I’m sure we wont get all that bored of each other 😄.
No idea where we’re going either, you feel like anything in particular?
ja sure thing.
I’ve got a list of places, I’ll get back to you, got to have dinner now lol.
Nah, Tommy's got his own - far superior I imagine - list.
Hey Ella, you still all good for the Scorsese thing on Friday? We were thinking of going at 2:00, does that sound alright?
k so nothing too pricey bc money. There’s a dumpling place that the internet tells me is good and v cheap, Shanghai Village. Or there’s another Chinese place that Tommy’s liked on fb, its not as cheap tho (Shandong MaMa). Or if you’re in the mood for ramen, that’s never pricey.
In terms of non-asian food, Bowery to Williamsburg apparently does v nice new-york style sandwiches, but like do you just want a sandwich to eat idk? Or there’s a few burger places. (western food tends to be more expensive lol 😊)
haha I should stop before this gets out of hand - there is too much food and too little time.
Haha don't sound apologetic, dumplings are among humankind's greatest inventions.
Yeah, and that's not the whole list 😅 I keep adding to it and like, it's too much, it's getting out of hand.
Yep, 1 sounds good. Or did you want to meet at fed square and then we can head there together.
Yeah true, we'll meet outside Melb central then?
Ah no problem, I haven't left yet anyway.
Haha I just arrived, nw 😂 ima go find someplace warm to wait then.
I'm wandering around the emporium. I'll meet you outside Melb central.
How about the Swanston st one. I'm almost there.
K I'm here.
Heading home now.
Hey what's the easiest way for me to send you the money?
If you've got the commbank app I think I can just send it to your mobile no.
Otherwise I'd need your bsb or something.
K so we'll meet at 2 tomorrow at fed square, near the big old acmi sign? How does that sound?
There's some kind of code you use, idk how it all works.
Was it $15? 12 for the dumplings + 3 for the doughnut.
Has it gone through?
Ah nw 😊. Same here, thanks!
Coming home, I think the interview went well. Tell you more when I get back.
Ok.
Ok I'm not far off.
Oh haha and here I was worrying I was going to be late 😄.
Nw it's all g.
2:30 is good.
I'm near rmit rn so I won't be long.
Nice nice 👌.
Here now.
Where about are you?
God you really are a tourist.
Behind you.
Cool, we're waiting in the entrance.
The one where there's a big sign that says acmi.
Probably too late to make a difference but I'm staying.
Nw 👍👌👍👌👍😎😎.
Yeah coming home now.
Hey look getting drenched was easily the highlight of my night.
Also you should just not listen to me as a rule of thumb I think we both know that.
On the tram now.
Yeah I even convince myself that I do, never a good thing.
Lol ella 😅.
Ok ok what's the best way for me to make it up to you ?
Food? Food heals all wounds and it doesn't make you walk 5 mins in the wrong direction only to get soaked.
No how could you it'd be a waste.
K next week I'll pay for one of your meals?
👉😏👉.
Or do you like need me to bake something as penance?
It's beautiful no?
And no, they'd be safe 😉.
Merry xmas to you to.
Sorry.
*might boost voice* I'm the moon.
*mighty boosh*.
Damn everything's going swell tonight.
And also sorry Ella for the onslaught of notifications 😬😬😬😬.
Oh man, today just get better and better.
Missed my stop 👌.
Pouring down rain 👍.
Standing in the doorway of a pub waiting for my poor mother to come rescue me.
💯💯💯.
High point of my life rn.
And yes, thank you Andy-Kat or your eternal words of wisdom.
Ah thank you thank you.
Hope you all enjoyed tonight's screening of Adrian fucks it up! : Again!
We'll be back next week with even more shenanigans and tomfoolery!
👉😏👉.
Yo before I forget, coming home I saw A MASSIVE HOT POTATOES STORE in Brunswick.
Looked run down af tho, so clearly their empires on the decline.
🔥🙋🙋🙋🗡🕯🕯🔥.
Shame there's no pitchfork emoji.
They have no hot potatoes??? Then let them eat cake!
Oh man really?? Sorry I had to leave.
Is it a full blown horror now?
Gotta call in Travolta to clear clear out the bourgeoisie and engage the class struggle now.
Just look at that smile, how can you say no to that?
👌👌nice nice  always down for some lobotomy.
Dang, he looks like a Vegas magician.
The Tremendous Travolta!🎩.
For my next trick—Illusion!—I will overthrow capitalism!
Oh shit, I was joking when I said he belongs in madam tuosodes but I literally can't tell the difference.
He's a true triple threat.
🙌🙌🙏🙏.
All hail God-Lord Travolta.
He's his own one man cult.
YES ‼️.
Travolts / Nic Cage double feature 😊😍.
Two of the greatest actors of all time swap their faces, and their bodies also.
Hey national treasure 2 was a great film, easily stacks up with Nic's best works.
Oh yeah, he's a Coppola. That's why he's so talented. Couldn't believe it myself when I found that out.
Also, yes to the marathon 👍👍💯.
Oh shit, yeah that's right 😂😂 man, he's a gift that keeps on giving.
Daaang 😎😎😎.
Yooo, so as it stands the gallery's still on for Wednesday. We're meeting around 1 at fed square and we'll all catch the tram down to it.
Hey so since we totally failed at watching a movie the other day did you want to go see one later this week?
👉😏👉.
That new Linklater film starts showing on Thursday, or there's the wailing ofc.
⚾️ or 💀.
❓❓❓.
Thank you for the lack of help 👍.
I don't know the times for ⚾️, the nova hasn't updated their site yet, but I'm sure there'll be enough times to chose from.
We able to decide on a day at least tho? I reckon we need at least a day to recover from the.
✨a e s t h e t i c ✨.
💥a d v e n t u r e💥.
No more for you to recover from spending too much time w me.
But yeah p much.
Yea.
Ooh, I can't imagine that ending well.
🙏🙏⛪️✝.
I'm praying for ya.
Is it animated at least?
👌apocalyptic vaporwave vibes.
You mean to say they're all Scully?? How could they be so logical?!!
👎👎for shame.
I mean, he's always right.
Like literally every episode.
Dang 😏.
Lookin fine duchovny lookin fine.
But yeah you would totally wear that.
Ooh yea, he suddenly looks a lot less appealing.
Verdict on the show so far?
Damn right you are.
The flowers haven't arrived yet. Mums left, should I maybe go past the shop and get them myself??
Or do you think they'll still come.
Ok sure.
￼Just arrived.
Yeah they look good! 😊.
Nice choice.
Oh haha right right.
Yep.
the only time ill listen to jb is when it sounds like he’s been transported to 1985 marty mcfly style and they put a gratuitous sax solo at the end of all his songs .
Yeah I did.
And I definitely will, provided I dot die first.
Otherwise my ghost will play it.
It's a common misconception that ghosts want to harm people, most just want to chill and drop an album or two.
I don't get his deal I sent him like 20 fully sik mixes brah but he won't respond.
Yeh deg that's more his style no? 😢😢😢😢😭😭😭.
Yo i think you'd appreciate this: apparently Andy's designing a book that's a detailed historical account of lenin's fictional exile in Australia.
And how he's been spending his time in Perth or something.
So he's not writing it, an artist friend of him is. He said he got asked to do it last year and he forgot about it, so I think he's still got a bit to do lol.
And yes it sounds amazing doesn't it 😄.
Was just going to ask that.
Maybe they can share the title.
Tru tru, he won't mind.
Morrissey tho? How do you reckon he'll feel abt it?
Your greatest moment, preserved for all time.
Tbh so would I if I was in your position.
I mean, the physical feat of the breasts themselves performing such a manuevor is something to brag about.
Or whatever, it's a rare skill is what I'm saying.
Kat Yu, professional boob barrel roller.
I guarantee, there's a lot new work in that profession than graphic design!
A lot more.
I'm stunned that there's no drum emoji.
💥👌👌👌👉😏👉💥.
Tru Apple has once again failed us.
Maybe iOS 11🙏🙏🙏.
Yes, how we've been surviving the last several years without those animations is beyond me.
Living like animals, LIKE ANIMALS I TELL YA.
🐷👉📱.
Damn you read my mind.
No1 most requested feature among apple exects for sure.
Execs.
Hey I was busy.
Yeah I realised that it was prob too trivial right after I sent it.
Oh yeah yeah. This week Saturday should be ok. Next week i fly out on Thursday though.
I won't be able to do next Tuesday though, but Monday and Wednesday are ok (well Wednesday might be tricky considering I'd need to prepare for the flight)
Otherwise after I get back from Bali on the 9th?? I'm completely free that week.
Look I don't mind personally, it up to you if you think it will be uncomfortable having him there.
If you don't want to be the one who invites him I'll be fine to do that.
💁💁💁.
I can prob see it ending badly tbh if he's there.
So who else would be going, you, Brandon, John, myself?
Yeah sure if they're interested.
Yeah 12 or 1 is fine for me, depends on what's easiest for the others.
Hey you still coming today? We'll be waiting inside acmi if you are.
Yo we're waiting inside acmi bc winter.
We're inside acmi, in the entrance where it says acmi.
We're are you? Ill come find you.
Where are you rn?
K.
Didn't get the job, apparently I wasn't available enough!!
Coming home.
I haven't left yet, he had to change the time to 2. I can maybe go past afterwards?
How much is it?
Coming home. Got the shirt, $96.
Yoooo, did you still want to see the 🐋ing tomorrow?
If so there's a session at 3:45 at the nova.
Up to you, for me it's prob easier just to go straight there since my tram passes it.
But its not a hassle either way.
You know how to get to it yeah?
Yep that should work!
👉😏👉.
You almost here?
Heading home, not raining rn but I'll text again if I need you to pick me up.
Yooo, you flying out today?! Have a good trip then!
Hey so is everything all g with the Nic cage-athon on Tuesday? 🎬🍕🍿👍.
Wait does ella know?
🆒🆒.
👌.
Almost there. On tram, it's at Bourke st mall rn.
Yeah I did sorry, it's something to do w Collingwood ask dad.
Coming home now.
I've got an appointment at 2, so sometime like 3:30 would work for me.
What about you two tho?
Yeah that should be fine 👍.
👍.
Yo I'm here.
I'll meet you on your level?
Again??
?
Heading home.
Frank@franzese.com.au.
There's one further up in next section.
😍 a true gift. I have never been more prouder of my heritage than rn.
Quality italo-disco 👌👌.
🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹💯💯💯.
￼I lied. The real reason I went to Bali was to watch the Korean kitten channel.
￼I lied. The real reason I went to Bali was to watch the Korean kitten channel.
tripendicular dude🤘.
Haha no, it's been real swell, v chill. Though I had forgotten what it was like to sweat 😅.
How's Melbourne been?
Oh, haha that's right you said your sister was moving there.
Enjoying the political turmoil or what 😄.
Nice nice 👌 gotta say I don't yet miss the cold 😜.
You staying in Canberra for long?
Oh a few days duh - my bad 😅.
Well, try and not freeze to death anyway! I'll see you, got to go.
👉😏👉.
Yoo, did you friend have a good time in Melbourne?
You do all the touristy shit you're supposed to do 😄?
👍coming up now.
Lol my kind of holiday 👌.
Oh are you back in the motherland?
And is that your cocaine stuffed picachu? V good children's toy that is.
👉👉.
Starting them young.
Ofc.
Ah yes. That would be right 🐻⬜️❌.
￼Bali has been good, as you can tell from the above image 👍👍.
Anyway I can go into more excruciating detail another time, I'm about to leave the wifi.
It's going to be difficult in a family of teetotallers, but I'll try ✊.
Dang they're playing never gonna give you up in the restaurant- we made the right choice.
Blue Monday now? All the jams 👌.
The Viet Cong? Idk.
Terrible joke.
Can you bring down the iPad.
?
You, which classes are you thinking of choosing?
So I can avoid them all obv.
Lol my one was going to b p much the same.
Looks like I got them tho.
So damn, stuck w you for a while.
Ikr.
Turns out Tristan's is similar too.
Yeah tbh this timetable also doent give you much choice so.
Tru tru.
Just let us be and no harm will come.
I made you this hat- WITH COMIC SANS!!!
Ah ha, suffer you treacherous wreck!
Anything happens.
cut to us - crying in corner.
Everyone is in the same situation.
Also ima go back to sleep, it's too early.
Eh it suits.
And ty.
Yooo did you get the classes you wanted?🙂.
Yeah 👍.
It's funny, I had no classes with Indra last time, now we ended up with the same timetable 😄.
How does yours look btw?
cool cool.
I’ve got the afternoon thursday instead though.
you still in canberra btw?
nice 👍.
ill see you at uni then, catch ya!
Yeah we got back Sunday morning. Happy to make the logo, can't say no to the moniesss 💸💸💸.
Does she have a deadline or anything in mind? It's just that I've got a couple other logos I'm supposed to be working on atm 😅.
Is that a previous logo of hers or something else? Is that the name too?
Does she want a recreation of it or just something similar/inspired?
So I've got an idea of what she actually wants from me.
Haha that's fine.
I'm happy to do either (copying would be easier but making something else would be more fun) also copyright could be a thing.
But the corporate overlords prob won't even care tbh.
Nah I think it would be fine.
Nobody's checking a small kids photography studio.
V Web 2.0.
Jk jk.
Haha no it's good, simple but it works well.
Some kind of record collection app??
Haha ofc.
Hmm yes it does seem a bit useless atm lol 😄another review app maybe??!
Phil Watkins would.
Only kidding I'm sure you've had enough of making review apps after that assignment.
Would it be like some kind of inventory then? I'm not really sure how useful that would be.
Maybe start with a problem first and go from there.
A virtual vinyl listening "experience". It digitally recreates the act of listening to a vinyl record without the hassle of the physical world!
Complete with authentic crackle, record skips, and gatefold artwork!
All in vr ofc.
Def def.
yep all good.
no, should’ve been for mum. iMessage on my mac is being weird.
Yup yup.
When would you go tho?
Not that it makes a difference seeing as I'm always free.
All g.
Where is it playing? Is it like a limited release or something?
Oh part of miff.
Oh my gee there's one called Emo The Musical.
In which a moody highschool Emo falls for a happy God loving Christian believer??
Story of your life much?
Re the tickets - 👉👉 sounds good 👍👍👍.
Ofc.
How much?
Easy.
And truuuuu!
Which is why I avoid Hoyts.
Last time I went they upscaled us to XtremeScreen $21.50 legit. Love goldblum but didn't need to see his face that large.
Exactly.
Expected more from him.
😢.
Hey with Adobe cc what did you put down as graduation date?
Dec 2018?
And yes I'm aware how last minute this is 👍👍.
Lol payment systems down 🙆.
Just left Brunswick.
At Victoria st.
Here now.
Haha what even is that?
Either way I think I'll have to give it a miss, I really need to work on a few things ie. Applying for jobs and sorting out this internship thing. Sorry! 😕😕.
OMG best Gmail feature: "you used the words 'is attached' but have failed to attach anything".
bloody lifesaver 💖.
Liked “Turn on coffee machine pls”.
Nonna's rung twice since you left, you better give her a call.
First one was as soon as you drove off, second was just now.
Hey are you doing anything tomorrow night? 🦉💫.
Hey it's prob a bit late but are you busy tomorrow night?
Hey are you doing anything tomorrow night? 🌙.
All g.
How's the activator thing going?
Oh sounds good then! Hope it goes well. I was just hoping to go out, been cooped up all week lol.
Oh I don't want to put you out, I'll see what happens though.
Haha thanks but I can't , with the family tonight.
Ah ok, I was just hoping to get out - been cooped up all week haha.
... How do you feel about OKNOTOK?
Hey I'm still up for tonight if you are. We can just talk and chill at a (quiet-ish) bar or something.
Hm that's an interesting take. Tbh I haven't really listened to the remastered tracks, it's not like their albums are exactly in need of it.
It sounds a tiny bit clearer and crisper I guess, but I'm not listening on hi-fi gear lol.
Not saying it's a useless cash-in though. I think it's anniversary came at too relevant of a time.
Imo adding the unreleased songs gives it the feeling that this is kind of it. Like 'here's the last of it, see ya folks' ☹️.
Up to you, kat and Tristan are both busy but if kaity is free that would be swell. I just assumed she'd probably be working or w ben tonight.
Not sure where haha, but I'm eating at home so maybe around 8?
Oh! Sophia and I were just going to catch up at a bar or something.
She's got to get up early tomorrow so it'll be a chill night.
Yooo our boy Tristan is able to come now!
Actually what was that Bimbo Deluxe place you went to like?
Ah ok, should we just go somewhere in the city then?
We're still figuring it out atm - we were thinking around 8 but if you want to meet up sooner that's easy.
Do you know someplace good in Brunswick?
Technically I should know but like, I spend more time in the city haha.
Ah ok in that case how about we meet up at yours and then figure it out then haha. I'm leaving soon so I'll be there at 8.
Hey we're just going to meet at Sophia's place at 8, then we'll figure out what's happening lol.
Yeah Ive listened to the old ones before. I do like the additions though btw. And yeah if they do call it quits this is a nice way.
... just as their prophecies  are coming true 😜.
I'm here!
Coming down.
Home now, was an early night. Do you want me to leave the porch light on?
Just resetting it now. Don't know why but wasn't working before.
Ok is working now.
Kind of want to go just for a laugh. Haven't really listened to them bc I just wrote them off as a meme but if you're keen then I'm down.
It should be an interesting show at the very least lol.
My high school friend just asked me if I wanted to go see death grips w him. Tempted to go just for the memes.
Just for a walk.
Do you need me back by a certain time?
Ah ok, will they be the same price?
Liked “yeah it will”.
Fuk u I'm hip with the kids.
In august.
Sad.
Around 4:30.
You've lost me now.
This is what Sophia and I mentioned last sat.
Or whenever it was.
Haha what a shame.
I think it was a two weeks ago actually, and Sophia and I mentioned the the British version of "Chinatown" from a certain TV show.
Oh shit really?
What time did they go on sale?
😢.
Gotta get in early with theses things.
Hmm, what do you want to do?
Plus I've got GA so we wont be with eachother.
You didn't find any resellers?
Oh Jesus.
😭😭😭.
Gotta find another band we can go see then.
I never got into the weeknd haha.
And yeah Lorde would've been very popular.
Hmm I had a look through songkick, not much that grabbed me. There's still tickets for Japandroids, idk if you ever got into them?
Wasn't that excited about their newest album but I enjoyed a few songs from their prev.
That's fair, it's pretty straight-ahead rock so I didn't think so.
I've listened to that one album of theirs haha.
The space one.
Haha actually I can kind of see that angle.
I did like it but idk if I'd go see them tbh.
Yeah thats probably a good idea.
Something will come up later in the year I'm sure.
Hey did you see that email from Blair about a processing workshop?
Haha yeah fair enough.
Either way I said I'd be interested, i kind of know what I'm doing but I'm sure there'd be stuff that I've missed.
Yeah it's a workshop, so I assume it won't be too structured (like getting us all to do the exact same thing)
It's up to you, I don't mind going on my own.
👍 if I do learn anything mind bending I'll prob show you anyway.
Also: something similar but more vector oriented is paper.js. I haven't really tried it but it seems neat.
It was based on an older plugin for Illustrator that let you essentially create generative stuff inside Illustrator.
But it doesn't work in cc ☹️.
Xiu xiu was here last week!!!!!????
I mean they're a big hit-and-miss band but man it would be a trip.
I remember you told me about them once.
Some of their stuff is very affecting and sometimes it just doesn't work at all. That said I did like their newest one.
Oh it was all the way in williamstown anyway.
Next time next time.
Hey so I know it's been a while but Adam and I were wondering if you wanted to catch up during break? I'm asking Anthony and Brandon if they're interested too. Maybe David.
Hey I know it's been a a while but I was wondering if you wanted to catch up with Adam and I during break. I've asked John and Brandon too. (Adam's in a bit of a different place now so he's promised to put all that ....stuff behind him and be civil etc etc, but if you're not interested then that's understandable I guess. anyway the offers there) Hope you've been well nevertheless!
Cool! Yeah if you want to, I haven't really stayed in contact with him woops.
Hey if you're not doing much of anything tomorrow did you want and get lunch with Tristan and I?
It'll be at 2.
Yeah look we've all been a bit shitty at that tbh.
Case in point --> how's the past semester been?
Yeah that's bit of a shame about the second one, but at least the other one balanced it out haha. It was pretty good for me too, I just had one course that took up all my time but the rest weren't as intense so it was fine. Anyway we can talk about it in more details when we see each other.
I'm just waiting on the others to confirm then we can figure out a good day 👍.
Ah ok, fair enough. If you're not too busy just the two of us could meet up sometime, be nice to catch up.
Also I'm running late.
Prob be another 10-15.
I was busy getting rejected by design studios lol.
Ye.
So John and Brandon are happy to meet up, I asked Anthony but he's not interested (well basically he doesn't want to see you, sorry)
Was considering asking David but like, I don't mind him on his own but in a group he can be a bit of a pain.
Yeah she's coming.
Are we meeting outside mc?
Hey I'm running late but Tristan is outside mc.
Swanston, by the flower shop?
At Melb uni rn 👍.
Lol we just spoke about it why wouldnt it happen.
I was thinking we could go to that wara wara kitchen from your bday.
In the mood for cheese covered chicken.
Fair enough I guess my bad.
Yeah just in city getting lunch w friends.
Also tell Sophia I saw a tote bag saying fill me up but Sophia's was better.
Mc now.
Meet u at ww.
Inside now.
Do you want us to order for you?
👍.
￼Pick a side.
Yep just waiting on tram.
Hey which studio you get?
I'm in site specific (queen Vic market)
oh cool cool.
suzie and shayna a great that one should be fun.
you heard from anyone else what they got?
hey which studio did you get?
lol.
nah i just asked tristan.
indra’s at work i think so she prob hasn’t checked.
hey, how did the pitch go?
I’m sure you would’ve made quite an impact 😊.
day’s been fine, just applying for jobs/internships.
hey have you seen which studio you got into?
Oh yeah that’ll be awesome! I got my first pref too: the queen vic market one.
I was cold-calling a bunch of places yesterday to sue out if they even offered internships/had any openings, got a few emails today saying they’ve got nothing on atm 😟.
so yeah, same old same old.
blood?
i got the queen vic one, first pref.
can’t remember lol. its with digital media but i didn’t recognise either lecturer.
should be neat though, i was tossing up b/w that one and the business one. that one seemed more theoretical/conceptual whereas this one is going to be quite practical.
hopefully!
i think blood is a good fit for you, was it your no. 1?
🌟.
hey Kaity and I were going to see a band, Saskwatch, on wednesday night. Turns out its at the pub next door to yours, you wanna join us?
$17.
fair enough!
Hey I'm planning on getting Kaitlyn's present tomorrow (some watercolour sketchbooks Im thinking). Did you want to come with?
Was thinking 1?
Prob Melb artist supplies in the city first then maybe a another place in Fitzroy (but still close to the city)
Meet me outside the flower shop again @ 1.
😊what a dapper lad.
👒😾.
~~welcome back also~~.
K I'll be a bit late my tram just passed me.
Ah ok. At Melb uni atm.
Liked “There in 5, after three cancelled trams...”.
Site specific! The one about Queen Vic market.
And you??
Ahhh damn ☹️ outback light show you've got to go to the outback don't you?
Mess is more is with Andy, I'd prob pick that one haha.
Although I think you'll be doing programming and stuff?? But I think he said you dont need prior knowledge.
Is it just between those two?
Yeah idk, was outback your first pref?
Hey Tristan and I were thinking Friday for round 2.
Coming home now.
haven’t had a read of it yet!
Although i think Tristan mentioned it once, he’s thinking of doing it.
(for chinese)
or was.
yeah I’m not sure either haha.
bit too subjective of a subject + differences in teachers = who knows.
Ah shit ok.
How long are they staying lol?
Oh that's barely worth the trip.
Have a good time with them then!
Also where did you go last night looked like some kind of art school student's idea of a rave?
Yooo so kat can't do friday bc she has some NZ friends coming down Thursday 😕 only staying till Monday though.
I, as always, am still down despite this great loss.
Lol sounds fun.
At the toff?
That's every basic's signature drunk pose.
Show me next time anyway.
The transformation is complete.
There's nothing you can do, you have to own it now.
Dog filter next right?
More of a giraffe filter man myself.
Fuck Yes.
Link me up boi.
Wait no I've already come across it.
52 Glasshouse Rd.
Collingwood VIC 3066, Australia.
Hey did you still want to come to the gig w me and Kaitlyn tonight?
Fair enough, but yeah sure no worries!
✨.
To Katy's? Yeah!
On way home now.
There's only 2 kinds.
Just a heads up I'll be there around 7:30.
I'm that dead souless look behind Mac's eyes, that gnawing realisation that a life so promising and young has given way to a rote and merciless existence.
Let's be real tho I'm John cenas cufflinks.
Are you coming to Kaitlyn s tonight?
Cool cool.
U ok?
They'd be some pretty decent cufflinks hey.
What days have you got?
They're like the inverse of each other lol.
How will you survive.
Gotta find new friends.
A new life.
Oh nice.
Don't think I have anyone woops.
Actually Sophia for my intern class.
Next time you see me I'll be a new man.
Ima go back to sleep now 👉👉.
Lol.
Enjoy the frosty cold beach should be pretty or something 👍.
Hey did you still want to do something tonight?
I'd prefer to not get completely sloshed tonight though.
Hey what days did you get for next semester?⚡️.
Cool cool, I can come round some time after 8.
Ahah I'm there Monday morning, Tuesday and Thursday 🐸.
Yes yes lucky me.
Did you end up swapping studios?
👨🏻‍🎨👩‍💻.
Yay that should be good!
Haha you can't disappoint him when he doesn't remember your name 😪😝.
I think you'll go fine.
Indra can prob tell you how to access his inner circle.
Nah haven't left my house yet.
Whats wrong?
...Just waiting on my tram now.
Ah ok then.
If it's that bad lol.
Oh haha.
You ok?
Oh good then (well not good good) yeah if it's easier for you we can do this another time.
When kats free too.

What were you making anyway??
Oh wow Jesus.
Damn lucky.
Hey I forgot to ask, what days have you got for uni?

couldn’t get w a pigeon maybe this will be better.
Ah yeah I saw the snap, was it a clash?
Im there Monday morning, Tuesday morning, Thursday all day.
Hey are you free sometime this week to catch up with Tristan again?
Hey did you want to catch up sometime this week ✌️.
Any day besides Tues and Thurs.
I can see if kat wants to join too.
Yea wednesday will be good 👉👉.
Around 1? We can get lunch or something.
Also Ella and I were going to meet on wed if you're free pls join 🐸⚡️.
Cool cool. We're meeting at 1 btw prob just at central.
And ok ill see when Tristan is free, I can't do sat night though and Sophia was trying to organise something maybe Friday but idk...
Typical.
Yep! Also I was talking w kat if we wanted to do round 2 sometime yr his week. I can't do sat and she can't do Thursday, what about you?
That is good with me I think.
Tomorrow night?
If Elly isn't keen on us making fools of ourselves then we could probably use oats apartment.
Kat's.
Although I haven't checked w her abt that.
Lol.
Just assumed.
Ah ok, when do you know if you'll be free Friday?
Actually nvm Sophia's thing is happening on friday now. You can come along too if you end up being free if you'd like 🐸🐸✨.
Was going to suggest this place but it might be busy.
We could either meet there or just at mc?
Easy easy 👍.
Still on today, meet us at mc @ 1 👉👉🌸.
Flower shop I think?
Just out the front.
I'm still in my way we both shit.
Although Ella hasn't arrived yet I don't think.
Going to be 5 mins late as usual👌⚡️.
🐸so sorry.
Yup!
Where are you were both here.
We'll wait at flower shop.
No Ella just arrived.
Yep that's fine - day off.
Will sort out my when I work tonight 👍.
Hey what did you want to do abt tonight? Kat is having dinner w Indra but she also has to help her parents with stuff tomorrow morning. I've got work tomorrow morning too so neither of us can really get too drunk lol.
Kat and I can both do tomorrow night, is that cool w you?
So yeah I don't think tonight is going to happen.
I've got an 8:30 class on Monday lol.
😢.
Tristan can't do tomorrow night 😕.
Are you going to Sophia's thing on friday?
Nah all three of us have stuff tomorrow morning so it's kind of off the table tonight.
You and me could still do something tomorrow night, if that isn't too depressing for you.
🐸.
Hey we know how to have fun, don't we? Don't we???
Is what not fun?
Anyway I'll see how I feel after work and get back to ya ~.
It says the event is at the student portal in building 10 level 7, so there I think?
I'm not 100% haha.
Brad's no. Is in the briefing doc I can message him if you want.
Hey brad, it's adrian. Just checking where we meet today for the shift - is it building 10 level 7?
Cool thanks, I'm still on my way 👍.
Yep it's 10.7!
Yeah I reckon.
Lol ok well maybe we can sort something out for next week then.
Hey that's Corey's friend and that's my electorate!
Typical petty bourgeoise labor.
☹️.
This is why we can't have nice things.
Also yes im keen too 🌸.
I mean, I'm open to a progressivegreens/labor coalition but not when shit like this is going down. Fuk em.
That's my political #hottake for the week - I'm out!
Yeah nah it's cold and I can't really be arsed tonight 💫😴.
We can figure something for next week hopefully.
— me, every week.
Good to know we're as unmotivated as each other to spend time together, warms my heart 💕.
Truuu the anniversary is coming up!
I haven't thrown up at all this year I think I'm due for a big one.
Lonesome puke then.
Was going to invite kat but she's busy tomorrow, and Ella's not really much of a going out type haha 😣.
Hey I don't like doing this but I don't really feel up to going out tonight. I've just had a bit of a shitty headache all day and not really in a fun-time mood haha ☹️.
You guys have fun and I'll see you on Monday at 8:30!!!! Bloody hell kms 😭.
🌸🔪.
Thanks tho ✌️.
Hey with tonight she doesn't actually start until 11 lol, but doors open at 8:30 (there are two supports)
Did you want to meet at 8:30 or later on? I don't mind either way 🐸.
Always down for some ice-cream 👌⚡️.
Hey I got here a little bit early, you far off?
I just walking up high St, I can meet you close to there.
These are the tickets for Pond if you wanted another look. I'm not hanging out to go (prefer to see actual game impala lol) but if you are interested then we could check them out.
Otherwise I'm sure something else will pop up eventually.
I'm on my way! Follow my Uber trip:

I should be free but I can confirm tomorrow.
Hey you ok?
🌝??? 👀 you got home ok?
Ah good, had me worried for a sec 👍.
... no more 8:30 classes??!!!!
Also wtf how are they only telling us about this now.
Check it student emails.
Internship is an online class.
Yeah I'll probably just leave everything to the last minute lol.
Although at least now I don't have a 5 hour break between this class and the lecture?
We'll see how this goes though, it shouldnt be too bad.
That means we don't have an other classes together though?
I've got my studio 9:30-3:30 (plus lunch break)
sure!
Um sure whatever you say.
W:28 L:32.
Ah haha what's wrong w your pants?
I can check to see if I've got anything larger.
Can I see a pic of the shirt?
Ah ok. Tbh those are most of my pants colours but I think my brother has something in green.
Damnn 👌👌⚡️.
When do you need them by?
Ok I've got a mustardy one (similar to her skirt) in a 28, a couple of browns in 30, a faded olive (too light imo) in 30 and a dark green in 28 (darker than yours)
I can send in a few pics later today.
Otherwise maybe your best bet is to swing past a vinnies/savers and see if they've got something, be around $5-8 I reckon.
Or have you tried Corey?
￼Yooo check out this shirt yusa made!!! 💕.
Colours looked a bit washed out but I tried to edit them to match as close as possible.
Yep I'll b there.
Also my morning intern class has now been replaced with an online class.
Yeah ok, did you want all of them?
Those aren't those ones.
E is more of a chino, dark dark green.
Well theyre all chinos.
Easy.
Finish work at 4, did you want me to give them to you beforehand (if you get there early lol)
That's fine.
Like who?!
Yeah they're a bit more pop.
M83 I knew had played here (was it last year?) But the rest I wasn't aware of ☹️.
We're they recent?
Were.
Just on here own or as part of a festival?
Oh they must've been as part of laneway then? I remember tame impala didn't have a sideshow unfortunately.
Ah i haven't really listened to them for quite a while now haha.
And I couldn't do this Thurs anyway. 😕.
Yeah same.
I've got Songkick, and that's useful most of the time. But ive noticed that it misses some very once in a while (eg xiu xiu)
Better than nothing!
There's one called Bands in town, haven't tried it.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Well, just from my perspective, there's more enticing things I'd like to spend $120 on lol.
Soz.
Yep I'm free.
Uh thanks I guess, low-key forget my birthday date.
Nah jk jk that's v sweet.
⚡️🌸.
And YES isn't the shirt  goddamn amazing I'll ask Tristan if it's for sale.
Yusa is getting him to model it lol 👕.
Lol kat wants to know if the shirt is for sale.
It really is tho.
I asked him for the link I'll send it through when I get it.
And thank you!! ✨💕.
￼Of fucking course he is.
Yeah you know I'm just so passionate about naturopathy, I love cures that don't work.
Just about any night, except Thursday.
Although wed and Thurs I have morning classes so...
no surrender.
Ah haven't had a look yet.
Is it different to the the internship website they were using previously? Bc I can access that one.
K just checked now, different site and I've got the same problem as u.
That's their motto!
Hmm just wait for the email I guess. If it's not up by tonight maybe give then pester her.
Sophia just informed me that lectures are assesed this sem.
See you tonight then lol.
At uni the lecturers are as if not more lazy than the students haven't you realised this yet 😜.
Please Chris came an hour late one time this is nothing.
I reckon it'll be up by 5:30.
Or it's prob some it glitch.
1 coffee.
Good luck then!!
Haha I won't have to ask I can just look across the room.
Itll be fine 👌.
Any sorry I've got to start working in a sec so gotta snub ya 👍✨.
👋.
Hey I've run out of coffee pamphlets and the nas maps, whether you've got the chance are you able to give me some more? Thanks, adrian.
Ah ok no worries. Also where did you say I had to meet you at 4?
Hey I finish work at 4 did your wanna get a snack before the lecture?
Construction workers at rmit jamming to some early crystal castles ✝️🔼.
Hey just finished, congrats!!! 🙌🎉.
I'll see how late we finish, can't get home too late though.
I was just going to get a snack before the lecture, if you want I can come past now?
Badoom tish.
Sadly, no.
😢.
Haha I'll see.
Trying to see if kat is free but I think she's asleep atm lol.
Ah I won't make it, just going now to get some chips or something.
We'll see what kat can do.
Friday for now?
Damn shame.
All g ran into Ella just now.
Damn.
Fair enough.
Fuck yeah.
Should've kept it for Steven to oggle.
Gross.
Whos to say it wasn't crusty to begin with.
Watches porn not for the story, but for the glorious graduations in tone and hue.
￼Gettin spicy here.
You just had to run off instead.
Smh.
Great shirt btw, better in real life.
But only available in China???!
Yep got in not long ago.
Cool haven't eaten yet.
come the fuck in or fuck the fuck off.
well done.
we got chris’.
Hmm probably. We just got an assignment.
And spaghetti.
￼"Untitled 4", 2017 Spaghetti, masking tape, string, pink marshmallow.
￼They have mogu mogu @ rmit.
Heyo, with that primary arcade talk as long as you get the tickets you're fine. No need to check in w Facebook or anything.
It's in building 12/14.
"the corner" it's called.
Best part of nas imho.
That one vending machine.
Also: Kaitlyn has organised this event/talk on Thursday night, if you want to come.
Ella's coming too.
Hey have you checked w kat to see if she's free on Friday?
Liked “i miiiiight be busy that night but if not ill come along 🌚✨”.
2 stops away.
Bitch you didn't even try to make awkward eye contact w me.
Out the front of building 8 lol.
Go up the elevator or use the lift.
Or do you need me to show you haha?
Are you in building 12 tho?
They're connected.
You can go the level 5 building 10 then just walk across.
Are you near the library.
👍👍👍👍.
What time does your class finished btw?
Ah cool. Nah I've got work till 12, then another shift at 1.
You free during my lunch break?
Building 12, level 4 it's called The Corner.
Next to Standing Room.
Yep that's cool, I'll message when I'm done here.
All done, where are you?
Do you need anything else from the storeroom? Got the trolley.
Yeah but in the office lol.
Haha yeah fair enough.
Gave the studio a call, they decided against it due to lack of space and it being such a short time, but they gave me a couple other places to try.
I'm going to email the coordinator and see what she says, if I can't secure something by census date I'm going to have to abandon ship too.
Do you print double sided corflute?
At dinkums.
Ah ok, Nas need it done later in the week bit I think they might be getting it done elsewhere.
Dinkums actually get their corflute printing done off site, my friend is checking to see if those guys do double sided but you might be better off with the other place.
Also I can do sat night if that suits the both of you.
Do you know if they can get it made by Friday? Otherwise do you know a place that can?
￼me @ work 2day.
Dinkums turnaround is 5 days he said, I don't know any places for corflute unfortunately.
Where did you get them last time?
Lol that sat is my birthday I totally forgot, working all day HAHA all that money is rmit's gift to me.
Oh yeah it should be fine for next weekend.
Actually it's for next weekend so it should be ok.
Belated birthday gift then.
And that's a no on the double sided then?
Try giving Melbourne city print a try, it's run by the same guys as dinkums but more business oriented:
No it's just I don't think they do double sided.
Surprise.
Liked “”.
Man this is such a confusing site design.
The assessment tasks don't have the right due dates.... March 20?!
I can't find it anymore.
HAHAH.
The email.
K I found it again.
is there another site?
on blackboard?
Oh Terry is a man woops.
Don't know why I assumed it was a woman.
ok there are a total of 3 sites.
1) the dark grey one we’ve had for a while.
2) the blackboard one which is sem 1.
3) and the email one, which is called sem 2.
in the url.
lol of he writes on medium.
*ofc.
... still nothing on how to find an internship, no tips, best practices , nada.
actually wait, they suggest i work at a country newspaper.
￼did you ever get a document that looks like this?
She says in the faq video it’s got info on securing a placement/interviews etc etc but it isn’t on the site.
...
I’m guessing they haven’t sent it yet bc it also covers during and after.
but like, it would been so handy.
maybe???
I assumed.
bc it ends at wk 11.
80 hours by wk 11.
fukk.
I’m going to send an email to terry or someone tonight telling him my predicament, and ill casually mention some of these issues as well.
i mean i don’t know anyone who has found an internship let alone knows whats up.
did polly find a place.
oh.
oh poor polly. hey at least its something.
maybe i should try aldi.
they won’t have me as an employeee maybe if they don’t have to pay me they;; consider!!! /s.
yeah idk, i get the feeling most places don’t really do internships any more.
was talking to my guy at studio mass, he said that all the small places don’t have the resources, and with many of the bigger ones  its hard to even get noticed.
the place that interview me.
there were maybe 5-6 places that I found that I found that offered internships, but they were either taken or not running atm.
out of however many i looked up.
should prob look outside of design studios i guess.
“hey adrian can you design us some more down-down arrows, but this time really just emphasise the downess. oh and add our hashtag on it too”.
someones gotta make those junk-mail catalogues i guess.
“can you put jamie oliver’s face on that”.
oh wait thats woolies.
truu.
well if coles has polly, woolies can have me!
are we making that a thing now, pulling a jesse.
I’m making it a thing.
jul 28 is the last date to add classes.
hopefully i can still enrol and get into another elective.
have you switched over yet?
...hey would the credit points from that summer class i did cover my elective this semester?
If i can’t find an internship nor switch into another elective.
it was 12 points.
Nice done more work than 95% of all students👍.
Ah fuck. No I didn't.
I can probably fix it later today.
I'm in class rn.
I have a lunch break at 12:30.
Ah shit.
What's the length of the handle that covers it?
Doing it now got a break.
Check your emails.
Haha nah thanks for asking me, I should've picked up on that.
Hey, what time does your class finish today?
Oh ok, I finish at 3:30.
We're you just going to go straight to the gallery tonight?
Hmm haven’t decided yet, if you guys are just going to stick around then I may as well stay and get something to eat.
I invited Kat too but she thinks she might be busy tonight.
Hey what time are you going to the gallery tonight?
👌⚡️.
I’ll see when Sophia and Kaity are going we can prob just go together.
... there's a bit of a hole growing in my black jeans.
Not sure if fixable or if I have to buy another pair.
🙄.
Cool cool. Ella and I both have class this afternoon so we were just going to head there afterwards.
So whenever you guys decide to go we can prob go together.
I should probably wait until I'm paid again first.
It's between my legs haha. Not noticeable (luckily underwear is black)
Well the thing says 6:30 so we'll prob leave at 6.
Unless we need to get there earlier.
Too much money haha. 86 Tram will take us straight there.
Actually train is quicker.
yeah should be.
thats fine.
In Enrolment Online, do you know what "term maximum exceeded" means?
I'm trying to add another elective but they all throw up that error.
The dot is green though, implying that there are places still available.
Right, but some people had enrolled in more than one. Like ivy had creative advertising as well as he internship in case she couldn't find a place.
Hmm.
Ah?
Can I get that from admin in building 9?  I'm here rn.
Ah I just had Toni, I should've asked her.
Hmm yeah it's prob better just to commit and drop the internship then.
I would then be able to enrol to replace it yes?
Without the form.
Little rogue.
You taking James?! How sweet.
Fair enough.
Yeah I was just in the mac lab.
Ah no.
Ok.
9 ish?
It's not for long.
Ah ok there's are power failure at jolimont.
How much h would an uber be though?
Ella doesn't have uber.
Just found out.
Tram is 45 mins, plus peak hour so it'll be packed.  Happy to take the train since it's only 15 mins late.
Otherwise we split uber 3 ways and Ella pays me back.
At rmit now. Ella will pay us separate just split w me.
Fuck I left my bag in the car.
It's there right.
Panicked for a sec.
Soooo is tomorrow night happening?
Im still down but idk how rowdy I can get, I'm coming down with a bit of a cold.
I'll have to see how I feel tomorrow.
It works out to like $3.50 to both of us it's no big deal haha.
Yep sorry phone died during the night. What is it?
K then so should we try and plan something for next week?
I have the family over next sat night for my birthday so I can't do then, am free friday night. Otherwise sometime during the week (maybe not when we've got a morning class the next day though)
Done.
Yeah it should all be good.
... When are you free though?
Do you prefer tomorrow or sunday to see the beguiled?
Nah I'm free this weekend.
Damn he looking so comfy.
But so rude.
The whole bed smh.
Aw hes upset bc you woke him 😾 ⚡️🌸.
Yep! There's one at 1:00 at the nova, does that work?
🐸.
👉👉✨ cool see you then.
Oven just dinged, I'll switch it off?
Hey I'm going to get there bang on 1:00 so if want to get your tickets before then go ahead!😬.
So sorry I did try and get there early but I decided to have a second serving at lunch woops. Walking down lygon street now.
Almost there it's fine.
Coming home now.
What time is restaurant?
￼Sign me up!
during the day I have work, but after that yep.
10-1pm.
I fucked up. I said 1 instead of 2.
I don't know what he's done I look like them HAHAH HAHAH.
Might get my friend just to buzz it all off.
Or I could start wearing a beanie.
Yes im waling back now.
Hey would you be up to buzzing my hair?
I made a huge mistake.
Went to someplace new and said 1 instead of 2 now I look like some idk.
Fuk.
It's entirely plausible that I'm overreacting but I don't want to take any chances.
Tonight could work lol we can provide the entertainment.
I literally just got it done I still haven't gotten home yey.
Don't get too excited let's see what my parents say haha.
I feel like I'm on an episode of Seinfeld.
Ok I don't think I'm going to rush into buzzing it off, I might be overreacting.
Am going to start wearing a beanie though.
Hey would it be alright if I borrowed your beanie, I don't have any good ones lol.
￼It's probably fine I just feel v insecure atm.
￼So I went to someplace near me I instead of Biba and I asked for 1 one the side instead of my usual 2😭😭😭😭.
Idk why I thought 1 was a 2 doi.
And I can't see shit without my glasses so I only realised that I fucked up after he finished it.
I was like, wait I asked for a 1. This is a 1. ....Ooh no...
I got the top right.
Well I alternate between 2 and 3. My hair grows quite quickly.
So hopefully it should be ok in 2 weeks.
Ahah thank you.
How did the pants go btw?
Yeah I don't really like how he's blended the top and sides 😬.
Hahah fair enough.
Did the shoot go fine though? Yusa posted something about not being able to book a studio.
I should be ok, my hair grows quite quickly which is why I usually have it cut short (just not this short lol) so it might be ok in a couple weeks.
Ah well as long as yusa is happy.
Hmm at least the black one, is the blue a navy?
Nvm just the black.
You can have them back in a month hopefully lol!
￼Haha hope so, the less time I spend looking like Richard Spencer the better!
Hey not sure if you know anything about this but my Saturday shifts have disappeared from when I work.
Just got friday now.
A real menace to society.
Not yet sorry!!!
I probably won't make it before hand today so see you in the lecture.
💧💧.
lol.
My parents are always watching Australian Ninja Warrior.
Every time I get home its on.
Im not sure how I feel about this...
Yeah I just saw it before that one.
Again, haven’t got high expectations.
Actually it kind of makes me feel uncomfortable that it sort of paints him as too much of an idiot.
There's this kid from my high school on qanda he's legit just a liberal party plant.
Everything he's said is just the party line lol.
The one with all the lapel buttons.
Dark purple blazer.
And just move to the country.
Parade College.
I must've missed the ice question lol.
Oh yeah.
I mean it's all connected lol.
HAHA I know rite should've been inside jacking to waifus instead.
Lol i don't even pay taxes.
#underemploymentLyfe.
Jesus my boy even supports the plebiscite what a stooge.
Nah catholic.
Haha you didn't miss much.
Also youdve missed my dad's 'insights' into the housing affordability debate lol.
Yeah I know.
Haha tru those eyebrows.
He's just like "nobody wants their house prices to go down!'.
Oh wow you got me dad.
Nah we can't address intergenerational-inequality now, you've just popped a pin right through my bubble.
Never mind the fact that all these baby-boomers all own more than one home, social housing is a joke, and 1 in 8 houses in Melb are kept empty to artificially stimulate demand. Nah, you got me!!
HAHAHAHA.
Yeah when we're like in our 60/70s??!
Plus if you have older siblings.
Sucks to be you.
I might get mine tho.
He's got his flute.
That is enough.
Oh yeah, I got it too short woops.
😭😭😭😭.
He like faded it too I didnt ask for that shit.
Yeah it'll be fine in two weeks.
Yeah may as well get my money's worth ya kno.
Phresshshshss.
Lucky u 💕.
At least it's official.
And he's not stringing u along.
Thank you, I appreciate it.
No she didnt.
But you mentioned it on Thursday?
Yes.
Yeah that's all g!
What was his name again lol?
Oh shit ya just reminded me.
My animal crossing is full of weeds!!
I used to have the ds one I don't know what it's called.
Haven't played it in like 8 years.
Hey, in this economy!
A man's gotta do what he's got a do.
The market is hard.
Your poor mother.
￼I look too much like a neo nazi tbh it's not on.
￼It's me now 😭😭😭😭.
Fuck you're right.
He and I are spearheading a new movement.
... 🐸.
I asked for it too short this time and I went someplace else so they kind of did it their way anyway long story short I'm now a fuckboi.
For like a week at least until it grows out.
^ me on friday.
U never want to be seen w me anyway.
Now u just have a good excuse.
I'll grow it out extra long for you this time how does that sound.
My new shoes are actually kind of painfully now 😭😭😭😭😭😭.
Those new shoes I bought are getting really uncomfortable😬😬😬😬😬.
Theyre still a bit tight bit the size above was too large (could fit my fingers in the back lol)
Mum seems to think they're not supportive enough lol.
I put some newspaper in the other day and they did stretch a bit , I think they went back since then.
But I think it might be something else.
No I mean I don't think it's just that they're too tight, could be that the soles arent supportive enough.
Like i could feel it in my ankles and even in my knees later in the day.
Yeah that's probably my only option, I just don't know if I'll be able to return them since I've worn them a few times.
I think I need to get some orthotics lol.
And the next size up haha.
Hopefully they won't notice.
That they've been worn.
I still have the tags and shit.
Even tho those ones were too big 😕.
Haha I'll try.
Did you already put the soda in?
Damn Italians.
Thinking we don't need no arch support.
Any ideas for something similar that's maybe a bit less painful?
Haha tru tru she does work in a shoe shop ⚡️.
Thanks anyway tho.
😢.
No more black skinny jeans either it's like we're not even friends any more.
Fashion just hates me.
Going to go past chemist warehouse to see what kind of orthotics they have, had a look online and they've got some scholl ones.
If I've got the innersole then I can try it on with the shoe.
There's two here that look ok. One is a proper innersole but they also have one that is just the arches.
I might buy both?
Hey what's wrong?
Can't talk rn,.
Can you message.
It's a 10 mins drive from my house but I've just had my shower I'm not really in a position to be going anywhere rn haha sorry 😬.
Nor my parents really.
Ohhh.
I've got class in the morning till 12:30 I think? I could drop them off on the way home?
Not sure what time I'll be leaving, but what time are you free for me to come past and pick up the magazine's?
Up to you.
Ifair enough, which shop is it I didn't think there was a mag shop there?
Ah the more you know, ive even been to the cafe next door but haven't noticed it before.
No worries, sorry abt before bc you were calling I thought it was super urgent lol.
Ahah all g that makes sense 👍.
Oh and ah also, I probably won't be able to make it to your place for drinks tomorrow night. Concert starts at 7 but I should get there early bc it's general admission, plus gotta have something to eat at home lol.
But Kat and Indra were going to go out on friday, you can come with us then if you're free!

To avoid a death grips situation.
I sent mat the idesign files?
I'm off campus atm I don't have any wifi.
The poster or the lollipop sign?
The InDesign for the lollipop is on my hard drive at home, I can edit the PDF sort of I guess ?
What was wrong with it?
And didn't you already print it?
???
My class is off site today so I can't redesign anything until this afternoon.
Sorry.
Is it the lollipop or the posters though?
Oh ok, Zoe and Matt both have the InDesign files for those. I emailed it to them.

Hey I made a list of some processing tutorials and inspiration.
(good for troubleshooting)
(Haven't used anything from here but they have a lot of examples/code for generative art)

(Book, can view online through library. Haven't read much of it lol)
(Mostly just inspo - not v useful but cool!)
(More inspo. More general, not just processing)
(crazy generative logo S&W made)
(make fonts w processing!)
+ all the stuff on the processing site which is usually pretty clear.
Haha idk how useful any of it will be.
It's one of those things where the best way to learn is just flail around for a bit with no idea.
I still have no idea haha.
Very.
❤️karen.
See if Indra has some tips too - she did something similar yeah?

17, or 1 Fazerdaze ticket.
Friend of my high school friend, met her at his party on sat.
You're sort of the plan b? Was originally planning a non-date date (bc apparently she has a bf? Just speculation atm) but got hit with the old 'so who else is coming' just when I thought I was in the clear. Luckily had you tucked away in case of such an emergency.
So now she's bringing one of her friends who I also briefly saw sat, but according to sources he isn't the bf either?
Probably over-neuroticising the whole thing ITLL BE FUN AND NORMAL PLEASE SEND HELP.
Yesss.
Plz.
No wi-fi atm.
So that'll be g.
🙌tyty.
Good idea.
How much were they I can NetBank you later today?
Where u @.
⚡️.
Shut up all of us are in the same train wreck.
No no this is some irl shit.
HAHAH no.
I probably wouldntve like explicitly hit on them anyway bc idk how that works and also im not trying to force anything just trying to go through life ya kno.
Like I'm not disappointed or anything I met them like two days ago but obv I drew a different set of assumptions based on our short interaction that put at least the question in my mind.
So yewh.
Ok tytytt.
OMFG my mums got the news on they're talking about a new Pantone colour for prince.
And they pronounced it Pan-tone-eh.

Yeah it's a lot less weird.
Could be fine.
Is arca on the album?
Wow is thus penance.

Maybe they did like "production" not so much "actual production".
Like they were just standing around in the studio at the time.
K anyway see ya going home then.
Wait so when do you leave for Malaysia?
We should have a little shindig before you go then, if you're not too busy preparing.
Caught in the act.

Hey will you be around uni at 12?
Typical 😴.
See you tomorrow at Sophia's launch party!
Are you a Mitski fan?
Oh ok, I really liked her last album.
Reminded me a little bit of St Vincent sometimes??
That's it basically.
Yeah I think id be keen. Although if you change your mind I could prob find someone else to drag along lol.
So no pressure I mean.
Tbh ive never really given them a good shot 😅 I reckon I'd be into them I don't know why I haven't really looked into them.
Too much mid-life crisis mid-2000s indie rock aesthetic perhaps? 😜.
When are they playing?
Heyyyyyyy do you like Mitski?
Hmm true and quite a while away...
Up to you ofc!
We can wait for the moment, I'll keep an eye on the mitski tickets and if they start running out I'll check in w you again.
Export as spreads?
Should I bring down the image settings to 150 or something since it's for on-screen?
And online.
Or does whatever service your using compress pdfs themselves?
Sure.
Whay are you using I can check their site.
They have an InDesign preset I'll use that.
But I'll send the full size one to you as well.
gdrive was being weird.
👌.
Hey I think you may have added my Tuesday shift into last week on when I work.
This studio group of mine I'm telling ya, got me missing the wildcats 😣.

Oh lol but I can meet her outside yeah?
Lol now they're playing neutral milk hotel you're missing out.
MISSING OUT.
You need to come through the side street.
There are signs.
Sorry, they were using my phone to run the POS. Am just waiting for the 19 tram now.
Nvm catching the 1 now, 19 was delayed.
What time do you finish class tomorrow?
I've got work but I can sneak out 👽.
That works for me, meet you outside building 9 around then 👍.
😊.
Hey I just emailed you the asos returns label, if you have a chance today are you able to print and attach it and take the jacket to aus post?
You can reuse the asos bag (on the ikea chair)
Thank you!

That's ok, I can make Monday work! ⚡️.
I'll be at work in the morning so maybe something like 1:30?
Enjoy the movie tomorrow🌟.
Tru.
Just pleasant though, nothing more exciting.
You better enjoy yourself!! You better have a good time!!
Idk it's too much pressure for me.
Can we meet outside the state library at 1:40?
We can go to little rogue and get coffee.
That's ok mAking my way over now.
Yep on my way!
That's bloody trippy.
I want to join that cult now.
I thought they used the plants to make the music?
Damn Atlantis technology 🙏.
Helps them grow apparently, so does talking to them.
So whenever you're lonely , head on over to your greenhouse. 😉.
True friends🌳🌿🌻.
Let's go to this place friday night before the show.
Yo work related qs 😜 do you prefer Orenda or Orenda Magazine?
For the poster listing the stallholders in the rmit market.
Noted!
Yeah sure will! We've prob got all that on file but I can add it in if I need to 👍.
Yeah idk probably not.
Don't think we're doing anything more than listing your names on a poster tbh.
HAHA soz.
I'm on the tram rn dw!
Hey do you think we should day anything to kat and Indra before tomorrow? 🐸🐋🌟.
Or just let them deal with it ahaha 😅.
stress eating.
it’s tough looking so cute.
nah i didn’t get it, wasn’t sure if mine went through either.
yep sounds good! 👌.
lol so weird.
🎀.
klassik kat.
￼My neighbours left their cat all alone while they're partying in Bali 😥.
Definitely.
He's got they're grandparents next door but he still comes over to see us.
Oh shit how much were they?
Ok sure.
Ga is fine with me!
I like standing anyway.
Myer?
No but I've seen the carol's in tv.
So it's on the lawn?
Hmm theres two kinds of GA seating. One on the lawn and one on a terrace.
Looking at the site now.
What's happening on your end)?
Ah ok.
Up to you then, you should probably decide since you're more of a fan.
I can wait a day if I need to 😜.
hehe that is a good enough reason for me.
You guys aren't on break atm are you?
Yeah, got this week off.
When's yours then?
Two thirds semester break? 🙃.
There's this exhibition on at acmi about women in gaming if you wanted to check it out sometime. It's free so we could prob also see a movie or something.
Oh yeah was confused a second.
It is, 10-5.
Saturday works for me!
Not sure what movies are on atm, see if there's anything that interests you.
I haven't see baby driver or Dunkirk yet, those are popular films right? 😅.
With that guy from portlandia yeah?
Haha same here idk I think Christopher Nolan is a bit overrated but that's prob bc he's popular and I'm pretentious🙃.
Also just not a war movie kinda guy.
Like we get it, war is shit.
Will probably be running late bc Im me sorry 😭.
Anyway 12 is good.
We've failed you once again 😔.
Just left melb uni so won't be long.
Here now!
BSB: 063122.
Account number: 10860693.
How I'm feeling rn woops.
😍😍😍.
￼Sort of kind of getting there... Not really 😂.
Theres going to be two parts.
One just spins around 360 deg, and this arm bit here is to change the radius.
Or that's how it works in my head at least.
Lol same if I get there.
💀.
I want to see your machine too when u work on it !!
... and then do the opposite... 😉.
🕺.
Anytime.
Oh I forgot to tell you, my brother's trying out to be a prefect so he's gone on a retreat tonight.
Little prefect stephen.
Loved “Good luck to him!”.
🕺.
Hey I'm working on a brochure map thing for nas, just wondering how I should set up the file so dinkums knows how to fold it.
It'll be in thirds.
I know how to arrange it I'm just wondering if you have a system to when it comes to folding? Do you do it by hand?
Ah ok then it should be fine.
It's pretty simple.
All good I wasnt sure if you needed like diecut lines or something if you had a complicated folding machine lol.
Yep it's pretty g, it's not too bad i reckon I break the style guide more than follow it.
1000 jeez.
Ok change of plan we now need 4000 and it's more complicated😅.
So yeah we prob won't be using dinkums.
Good thing you told me abt all this otherwise you'd be stuck with folding 4000 a3 brochures.
If we did print them with you how much time would you need?
It'd the same fold essentially.
Fair enough.
7:30?
Yeah I'll meet you there.
Out the front.
Need me to print tickets or are you good.
On your phone should be fine I think.
Hey just got home, hae to leave soon - can I reheat lasagna or should I just reheat the last pasties.
K.
It's at northcote social club, I need to get there at 7:30.
Liked “yeah i have them saved on phone so should be fine !! says on tickets ”.
I'm almost there.
Lol ofc it is.
You bet!
Hey just finished, you still able to come pick me up or should catch an uber?
Actually dw I'll catch an uber.

All about the 86:
Hey do you like Mitski? She's playing here in dec I'm trying to rope someone into going w me.
Just passing rmit, should be 5 mins?
No toilets there got to use the novas so I'll meet you up here.
Coming home now.
The moment I try to lie down and take a quick nap I'm attacked for taking a nap 🔫.
😔 I need to move in with people who'll accept my lifestyle choices. This is who I am ✊️ #righttonap.
Master lupi🙏.
WHAT A GOOD BOY😻.
Arrrh hes really too cute ☺️.
Fair enough I've got a few contenders atm.
Hey did you want to meet around 4 tomorrow?
☕️🍩.
Hey sorry I had sauce all over my hands.
👌🌟.
Do you want to meet me by the homemart next to my office, we can grab some snacks ☺️.
So I guess that means that I'm the blue cardboard cut out?
Ella wants to be the baby heart.
Almost there!
Ran into Kaitlyn sorry.
Ella and I are just in the back of cha time.
We also brought some snacks from hometown next to my work.
All set for the lec.
On my way.
Heyyyyy soooo not sure if kat or ella have told u yet.
But Ella and I have started dating✨.
Or whatever it's called.
Nah I don't know what she sees in me either lol 😅.
Just thought we should warn u and also don't want to make u feel like we're keeping secrets from u 🥚🌟.
Hey I won't be at class tomorrow unfortunately, got to go in to work for an hour and I've got this one project I really need to finish before wed. 😬.
If there's anything important are you able to send me the notes please! 🙏🌟.
Thank you!
Tytytyty we appreciate ur blessing 🙏.
I had no idea she felt this way until like a week and a half ago.
Still hasn't hit me yet lol.
Hey I don't think I'll be able to meet up with you tomorrow 😭😭😭.
Have a work meeting after class, then a studio group meeting, then back at work until like 5:30/6 💀⚰️.
Rocky horror sat?
That Astor thing.
😣 I'm stressing.
Trying to get this map printed for the event so I need to get it done by Friday but everything is constantly changing.
But the printers want to be paid first before they start printing, but like our credit cards are maxed out and it takes a month for rmit to process payments😅.
Sorry I'm unloading this on you haha.
Itll be fine if we can't get the payment through in time I'll print it somewhere else 😒.
Tytyty🙏🌟.
Not the riso one.
That one is on hold atm haha.
This is another print shop.
They have a folding machine, dinkums doesn't, we need 4000 maps lol😅.
Oh hey I got those Chicago pins eckerslys does still sell them.
😍.
Haha it's all g ☺️.
A girl brought in baklava today at the office so the job does have its perks can't complain too much 😉💖.
Hey Pauline what's up?
Haha you picked the wrong week😅.
What do you need?
Haha it's after Celebrate Rmit so yes should be ok 👍.
Yeah I'm there most days p much. Whenever I don't have class.
Yeah I'm doing a bunch of stuff for celebrate atm.
How's your new job?
Ah damn guess I can't complain then lol.
Doing signage and way finding mostly, a map, plus a bunch of posters.
Plus whatever flights of fancy pop into janeene's head 😜.
Is this that info graphic thing you were feeling me about?
*telling me.
Didn't I already brand it haha?
Fair enough.
Yeah I mean it should be ok.
Will you pay me? Haha won't be a lot we all students here.
Nah no way.
$30 p/h is steep lol.
We can have a meeting in a week or two where you can explain to me the details etc.
Yeah whatevers easier.
👌.
It's also the fact I think that I've been so busy at work that we haven't had heaps of time together aside from getting coffee and lounging around.
Which is basically what we were doing before loo.
But ive snuck out of work early a few times to meet up w her it's been nice 👌.
￼Doesn't actually work 😣.
But it looks cute 👌.
Should probably head to work but ice got 30 mins b4 my meeting. You around?
Ahah that's ok.
Glad u think so!
Did u want to name it?
No rush👌.
During the yes.
Maybe also at night nit sure yet.
Sorry meant during the day in free.
That should be fine!
I was going to see rocky horror with Tristan and his friends but I haven't heard back from him 🤷‍♂️.
Either way I can probably see both.
Which film is it? 🌟.
Ooff the depressing one haha 😅.
Haven't seen it but been meaning to.
We should also another time see a more lighthearted one just to balance things out 💖.
Hey what time does your afternoon class finish today?
I'll see if I can duck out and say hi depends how busy I get here.
Sounds good I'll let you know 💞.
Oh that link I sent last week to u and Kate?
Oh nvm it sold out lol.
HAHAHA.
next time?
Haha Tristan just messaged rocky horror sold out.
It was like a shadow cast at the Astor so they have the film and then people miming along on the stage I think?
Is it?
I've never seen it come up before but I'm sure they'd show it plenty.
Anyway so I'm free the whole of Saturday then 🌟.
Hey so that rocky horror thing sold out 😔.
If we go some other time I'll let you know 👍.
Going on a date w Ella instead.
The horror!
Oh yes is she a fan too?
I'm so behind no spoilers.
Haha yes I wouldn't expect anything less.
I expected that tbh, judging by the pacing of the episodes in the last third I could tell so much was just going to be left unanswered.
Which I kind of like? Sometimes over explaining kills the magic you know?
Very true.
The series has been really cool so far, definitely watch it. Might be better as a binge watch because it'll be less frustrating?
Yeah I mean I find I can only watch 1 or 2 a day😅.
Or rather week.
Loved an image.
Ye it's showing at hoyts nova and acmi.
Up to u!
Is it just one showing?
Liked “All good, gl with your date 💯”.
I mean I'd like to see both at some point, but if this is the only Nausicaa showing then let's go with that?
What time is it?
Me either!
Sweet.
Could do with a snack rn but I'm in the middle of something😔.

Hey Ella had to catch her last bus, if you guys are still awake I can come past now?
She wanted to come but we wouldn't have been able to stay for very long.
haha.
Yeah fair fair.
Yes it was really good! We had dinner at a cute little pizza place, kissed in a park, then had a drink at a bar while we attempted that '36 qs to make someone fall in love with you'.
Mine yes but not hers.
It was a little awkward perhaps I was a little over enthusiastic at first (note to self don't eat her face) but we got there eventually.
Still though I should try and work on my technique.
Hehe.
💕.
Yeah ofc, nah this was just like the first 'proper' date.
All g.
On my way back now.
HAHAHAHA.
Ty.
I'm glad to be the centre of the subutb's scandal.
Suburb.
Just a dumb joke.
Ah that's a shame.
Hopefully this is rather stable tbh.
No she's not confrontational.
Which can be good can be bad sometimes let's not get caught up in trying to ruin a good thing.
A don't like shaking the pot either.
*I.
Anyway.
Things are going good!
Want to meet around 4 tomorrow?
Brilliant✌️.
I think you're supposed to... Not sure about bus zones. You'll just be charged full price instead of the (maybe) cheaper price.
It's not time based it's zone based.
Oh cool how we're they?
Was Brigette working today haha?
Right be running late.
👌.
No prints have been sent out yet.
haha all good.
Is it for tonight?

Rmit stop.
Ty I'll give them a call.
They bloody messed my map up.
Won't fold now.
Got to do damage control.
No the designer.
My fault didn't explain my guides.
They made her add more text in so she just lengthened the front and back panels so it was no longer a5.
Ergo didn't fold up.
No we got an email proof today.
Printer did a test and was like hey guys not right.
So nuts.
I didn't like the final map anyway now I can fix it I guess.
She did a better job than me getting all the text in just something went wrong with importing the map.ai file some background layers got turned on.
This Friday?
Should be ok how long will it take(.
By making new layers lol.
But pdf fucks things up a bit it's prob a tiny bit better in the original.
Yeah should be fine we'll do that.
But not much.
Bloody architects.

￼Ur look of disapproval haunts my every moment.
How are you going? 🐶.
Glad to hear ☺️.
That's ok, I could tell something was up.
Sweet lupi 🌙.
Sweet will do.
Maybe you want to play with this notion of antiquity and progressiveness?
Old fashioned values in modern world still?
But also progressives going back to 'good old fashioned help each other out' values.
Design looks very clean and contemporary at the moment, maybe you want to contrast different sections with a more classical look.
I think I the fact that you went to the medieval grid could be a good starting point.
Maybe highlight that in some form? End pages or something - nothing major.
Hope so! Was just random walking thoughts.
Don't stock the green one anymore.
There's a few others I could try?
Red one is 10.80.
Should be.
~Trendy~.

Not sure yet, we're still here at a relatives place just finished dessert.
In a food coma rn lol.
Not Nonna's so not 💯just an aunt bit still ggg.
I don't know when we're going to get going tbh.
If I don't message to say I'm on my way feel.free to go out or whatever.
Stop calling y'all I'm still with my family.
💫.
It's k.
It's ok.
We're still here haven't left yet.
￼Thanks Telstra.
So like we just left their place.
I highly doubt it.
Soo we just left.
I don't think I'm coming.
My family.
I'm sorry!
But it's like 11:57 already.
No way I can convince my parents to let me go out now haha.
I'd only be there for an hour or so before I'd have to go back home.
Hey I graced ur presence two weeks in a row.
Yeah I don't think my parents will be keen also I have to get up at a reasonable hour tomorrow haha.
Are you going to the anime thing tomorrow?
Terrible.
I'll take that as a nooooo?
Let's be a little more realistic, 10:30? 🙃.
You haven't left yet have you?
Ahhah sorry.
Here!
🐱🌟.
On my way back now.
Hey are you doing anything tonight? Feel bad for flaking yesterday.
Heyo yeah that's quite alright, I'm so behind myself HAHAH 😬.
Corny to say it but combination of balmy weather and listening to blood orange reminded me of Kate's place and pineapple juice flavoured vodka-goon.
Wanna do it again sometime ☺️.
Yee sounds good 💫.
Awwww I'm dying 😚.
He looks quite the dapper cat 😸.
Hope your parents got home alright 🌸.
Goodnight! 🌙💖.
Haha we've swapped 😜.
Hey, meet at 2 tomorrow?
I’m not sure where to go/what to do haha it’s supposed to be raining :(.
Sounds good! 👍 ✨.
Well meet at the library again then walk down 💖.
wait i mean state library.
hey we just have to write about two speakers for this thing yeah? Most identified and least?
no wait is it more just a general thing? Sorry lol i wasn’t really listening in the class 😑.
Ah ok, just waiting on my tram now.
🐱👍.
Ahhhhhhhh.
No.
An anorak?
Well rain jacket technically.
I can wait in the foyer otherwise.
Ella to the rescue 💫.
Here now message when you're near.
On my way back.
Already had dinner.
Home now.
Spec design was very divisive lol.
Just me and one other who liked it, p much everyone else hated it 😅.
Oh that's right you weren't there for it ahah.
ooh where at?
I should be down, I’ll check if Ella’s free tonight.
Thanks for asking!
Hey Tristan just messaged me, he kate and their roommates were going to go to a comedy show tonight but kate and caitlin pulled out.
He just asked if you and I wanted to go, you down?
hey btw do you think this looks dumb?
Its a tote for a work friend’s uni project, they’ve got a showcase at melt convention centre and Im doing some collateral for them.
Yeah tbh their name doesn’t help. Their product is like a belt beacon thing for farmers that sends a signal/message out if they fall over.
Don’t think anyone else will have totes, and people need something to stuff their pamphlets in.
hmm yeah Ive got a few other variations. need to find a balance between general enough for people to want to use again/not be embarrased to use it, and actually useful as a promo item lol.
haha true lol.
wouldn’t say the tote’s for farmers, it’s mostly business people/general public.
but yeah i see your point.
￼this is the logo i made earlier in the year for them, which eh I’m kind of over now but whatever.
dat potato lol.
(they wanted to copy Stark Industries from Iron Man, hence everything p much)
Yeah it’s very corny, which i think will be refreshing don’t you think?
What time is the show tonight btw?
Still waiting to hear from ella.
All good, he didn't say earlier. Waiting to hear back.
I'm guessing it'll be around 7/8 pm? It's in north melb so near them.
26 Errol Street.
North Melbourne VIC 3051.
Australia.
Hey what time talking to Ella rn.
7:30 he said!
Actually 8 I spoke too soon 😅.
If you can't make it that's all g no pressure!
👍ty.
She's at her friends place atm so I'm not sure if she is able to make it, but I can come regardless.
Let me know when u know 💖🌟.
☺️👉👉.
Ok she can come!
Should we meet you there?
Or at yours then go together?
26 errol st?
sounds good.
Tristan said we can meet them at the place.
Takes ~12 mins to get there from MC, tram comes every 10 mins. So meet out the front of MC at around 7:30?
is that enough time for you?
Haha yes hopefully mine won't be late neither😅.
Doesn't matter if we get there late - probably won't start right on 8!
Ok just caught one now should get there by 7:35!
It wont start right on 8 will it?
Just left now hopefullt ella and i wilk get there in time, otherwise 10 mins late.
Only a couple more stops!
I see u from my tram 😜.
On our way!
Also who is it?
Walking down now.
My tram always seems to arrive exactly 1 minute after your bus. Perfect timing 🤔.
Heyo thanks for asking us out tonight!! We had a good time don't know what that awkward goodbye was about lol.
Say hi to the others for me 👋.
On my way back now.
Seems like the only logical reason.
Nope on the 1.
No!! Don't be! No later than I usually go to sleep 🌙.
Travel safe 💖🌞.
💕🌃💤.
lol today is feedback day for the final project 😑.
could’ve stayed home.
lol should’ve read the notes online beforehand I’m freaking out.
yeah I’m here now.
still i mean.
idk lecturer thinks i should do another drawing machine.
We have to make a ‘useless tool’.
it’s getting quite weird now haha.
hehe same here.
He suggested some kind of portrait device, that made a drawing not based on what you look like.
same but no idea how to make it!
if it drew something very abstracted it could be easier maybe?
Hm yes maybe!
Which was inspired by another of Andy’s machines haha.
haha neither do I it will be very very simple.
I can use processing perhaps for the audio stuff.
What if shadows were the drawing?
Wasn’t someone doing that in your class?
I can make a contraption that casts shadows and control its movements with the arduino.
Hmm 🤔.
It means I don't have to worry about moving a pen around which should be easier.
Yeah he’s design bae #1.
💖.
I'll be in 9.2 having lunch.
Oh shit yep sorry.
I was waiting to get paid before but I must've forgoton.
120?
Sent it now.

Spent half an hour trying to reset my password and log into staff rmit 😑.
Very kind of her but I'll see! Can get an uber to the station.

Safe and sound 🐶.
Sometime in the afternoon, like 3/3:30?
Well I mean Peter Thiel had it coming!

Yep that should be ok 👌.
Did you need me to bring anything for our picnic?
Love em ✨.

Dinkums doesn't have a price sheet online unfortunately. Sitting next to my friend who works there and he said around 20/25.
Yep I'll get this ready.
It really depends on how busy they are on the day sorry. Assignment time ya know.
If you get there when they open you should be good.
Just one page? It should be done in a day.
It shouldn't take that long. It takes 15 mins to print one but the wait comes from all the students rushing to print their assignments haha.
So if you can get there at 8:00.
Just before lol.
Badges are $0.50.
Sticky institute.

The Mafia only drinks chinotto.

I found this the other day:
Hi Diana, just letting you know that I have an exhibition on at Noir Darkroom at the moment - 57 Moreland Rd Coburg. It's a great space to learn about gallery & exhibition design etc - for Stephen that is. Anita is going to be sitting the gallery tomorrow from 10-2pm.
Hi Silvia, this is Adrian but I showed mum. Stephen has school tomorrow but I was going to go past instead. How long is it exhibiting till?
Aw I'm sorry 😔.
Oh sorry. 😺 It's on til Sunday. Gallery hours are 10-6. That would be great!! By the way, they are seeking expressions of interest in their zine exhibition coming up in Nocemver. Grab the details when you go in if you are interested.
Did you say to come past at 1 tomorrow?
I'd like to have a sneak peek if I can?
Feel a bit weird tho haha.
Ahaha.
If that's the case then I'll come past around 1ish, hopefully they'll still be on display and everything?
Also Tristan has decided Wednesday night next week, is that ok?
😙👌.
How long was the wait haha?
Was this your booklet?
👌 (don't tell Tristan and Sophia)
Dinkums put their prices up around this period anyway, to capitalise on all the last minute assessments 😏.
Hey are you in the city rn?
Is that why you sent the little print message?
Ah lol.
Nvm, I was at the exhibition centre to have a look at my friend's engineering project - just fine finished now.
I'll see you tomorrow💓.
Didn't get the job 😔.
Hmm hope so 😊💖.
He looks very angry in this one 😕.
Hehe.
Morning, should I make myself a coffee or are you coming back soon?
Well thank you lupi anyway 💖.
Where is your class, I'm on my way.
That's all right I was running a bit late anyway haha.
Should I come past now or you still going?

Hey just fyi Tristan got some allergy results back and it's a bit 😬😬😬.
Circled is what he can't have. So if you were going to make something best to avoid them.
Also no wheat/gluten and dairy.
￼And these are the details!!
Ahaha yeah I know it's a bit like that.
Same here lol.
How many more invites did you want? There's no minimum.
Need to hand it in at 9 I think?
Can't remember.
But come whenever you want to!
Hmm not sure, I'll still have to hide the pieces so that might take a bit of time...
After I hand the map/clues etc in I mean.
Yep that's good!
Was going to go to dinkums but 😦😦😦😦.
So packed.
Will have to go to little print tomorrow morning haha.
Smh tried to finish it by 3 but that didn't happen.
How long did they take to print your book?
Printers was packed!!! Will go past tomorrow morning to another one that's less busy.
Come g back now.
Oh easy.
Yeah.
They open at 8:30 but mines due at 9 😭.
I'll set 20 alarms.
I can nap until 11 haha.
No 11/11:30 is fine 👌.
Unless you want to come later?
💖🤙.
See u then!
Oh my god you won't believe this.
I got off the tram.
Walking home.
Someone calls out to me.
It's JANEENE.
she lives like 3 streets away from me.
Shook.
She had the speaker bin out the front lol.
Idk it was just on her porch she mustve just taken it ahaha.
When has the rules ever stopped her parents Pauline.
Hey I think I'll make a frittata for wed. Itll have eggs, potato, roasted red capscicum, maybe a bit of pumpkin or sweet potato. Does that check out?
👌.
😊.
Ah ok no worries.
I'll meet you outside qv.
￼Last one!
Oh hmm.
Tried calling?
Hmm I guess she's just running late.
Rosanna is quite far 😅.
😕.
Do you know which part she usually works in?
Tried all other possible contact methods?
🙌.
Just hopped on the tram now.
💖 no. 6.
Yeah just getting off now.
￼First test !! 😬😬🙏.
Nonna just rang, back from dromana.
Sort of.
First one I left for a couple hours, but it didn't really show after I washer it 😕.
Trying another one now with a stronger light, it's looking a bit better.
￼Test one using the sun worked though!
I think the problem is the uv light coming out of the torch is just in the middle, so it only develops one spot.
￼Well, it's a bit of an improvement!
I think I might have to use the sun to get a proper exposure.
Pop it in a box outside maybe?
The solution was 40 bucks I'm going to get this working hahah!!
💸.
Yeah I'd like to keep experimenting with it, it looks very cool when done well.
You can try it too if you want!
It's quite simple.
If you print out full sized negatives on tranceparent paper you can use it for photos.
Loved an image.
Mmm even better.
Delicious giant cookie ❤️.
So brave 😍😎.
Laughed at a Handwritten Message.
Aww.
Poor spider.
Still brave to me 😙.
Hey did you still want to piggyback on my gift? Idm!
Just so I know what's up and it isn't awkward when I give it to him lol.
"hey this is from me".
"And me too".
"Oh yeah and Sophia " 😜😅.

Have you got a card? I haven't made one yet.

Also would you want to go see Vince Staples? Does Yoon like him?
"who, me?!".

Furtherest thing from horrid 😽.
Oh lol fair enough.
Probably leaning more towards Vince atm but we can wait.
They've been out for a little while and haven't sold out so there should be time.
Oh I keep forgetting lol.

Arrived not long ago!
Thanks ☺️.

Shit you're right there is a section of Sydney Rd where every second store is bridal wear.
Never paid much attention to it before haha.
Very 😄.
Like just a block or two though - then it reverts back to lebanese bakeries.
There's a real good one in the side streets of Coburg, will have to take you one day ☺️.
Very stylish 💯.
Are you on campus rn, I'll meet you there?
I'm pulling up to the QVM stop.

I'm not joking this is a real product 😂.
*bus advert.
Horrific more like it!
☺️so sweet 😘.
￼Mark two.
Hehe.
15 mins didn't seem to be enough, I'm trying it again for about 30 mins.
🤞.
￼Thought I stuffed this one up but it actually kind of worked?
Maybe I'm leaving them out for too long - so they over expose and the shadows get too light?
￼With headphones.
Are the zatar for Stephen now or dinner?
He just made himself a tea.
📍 East Elevation.
351 Lygon St, Brunswick East.
This is the place for tomorrow, look for the red door!
Just stepping out for a bit, my friend wanted to catch up.
Will be back by 5,5:30.
Hmm 12:30? Will that give you enough time?
Otherwise 1 is good too 😘.
Sounds good! ☺️.
See you then ❤️❤️❤️.
Hey what was your elective in semester 1?
Yeah the one with the intense male lecturer I think?
Yeah no sweat, was just talking to Tristan abt electives.
(I need to do a school elective next year bc I did a uni one last sem)
Actually were going to get something to eat here sorry 😄.
Hey part of my tram ride has been replaced with a bus bc of road works. Not sure when it's coming so i might be a little bit late!
(doesn't take long for me usually though so I won't be that late.
⭐️⏳.
Just passed other side of road so won't be much longer!
Thank you! On the tram now just 4 stops.
It doesn't feel as bad.
Every 6 mins!
Wait shit we're on the wrong side!!!
This is towards Flinders st.
Sorry!!!
😑😞😬.
Got my bearings mixed up as usual!
I'm so silly haha sorry.
Ahh.
No it's my fault.
Anyway have a good weekend 😘❤️❤️❤️.
Yep I'm on my way back.
Perhaps hehe⭐️.
The face he makes when he knows he's getting a weekend full of snuggles lol.
Yeah probs not sorry 😬.
I'd come over tomorrow night instead but now I've got to mind my siblings while the parents are out lol.
Hehe enjoy 😘.
Sophia home now.
Success!
￼😮.
Ahaha thank you 😘.
Also are you free tomorrow?
Smashy smash! 😄.

Did you want to meet around 1 again?
Was going to suggest somewhere else but I want to try and get some paper tomorrow morning so I'll see how it goes.
I'll let you know later tonight ⭐️👍.
Hey let's make it the city bc I need to print off some test invites haha.
💕.
￼Yeah she's fine.
We haven't heard anything haha.
Yeah I just saw it now 😬.
Well both Sophia's are fine so that's ok 😄.
Also I can come out tonight I'll see how ella feels as well.
Just to be safe can we make it 1:30?
I ordered a jacket online last week it should be coming today, just fyi.
Sorry was at art store.
Stare library?
Coming home now.
Spent all day trying to think of a more awful pun but can't top it.
The "damage" is done.
👉👉.
Here, finally!
Soz for being so tardy 😘.
Not going to lie.
Woah.
Aw he's just a big softie under it all 😄.
Yes thanks!
How much was it?
So cheap!! 🙌.
Enrolment opens tomorrow morning by the way.
Just a reminder.
Yeah same haha, I'm going to pick a couple then decide later.
No, haven't heard back! She went back home so not surprised she forgot.
I think there's a massive pdf with all the uni electives some where... But it's just a list I think.
there’s this, but it’s a search box.
I think the school electives aren’t in that one though, only the ones that are also open to other schools.
bc I can’t find Communicating Brand Narrative.
so conveluted haha.
did you end up emailing Suzie?
I might send her an email tonight.
yeah, or more phrasing it as ‘did a non-school one last time, do I need to make it up next year’.
no don’t think so?
I think Sarah mentioned she enrolled in heaps lol.
me three ❤️.
By virtue of the smiling popcorn puff itself.
Did you want to meet at 1 tomorrow?
💕⭐️.
I was going to try and get my haircut before then, but we could meet at 12 instead?
If I go at 11 that should be enough time for me.
Whatever you prefer!
;QRY=%20owner=000017%20+keywords=(VART3480)
Artist's Books.
Im thinking I might do that sem 2, bc tristan’s elective is only running sem1.
and so is karen’s one 😟.
Communicating Brand Narrative.
sorry i meant the one he was telling me about.
(which you also did for a week lol)
Im not sure what other media/comms one to do!
HAHA.
even better.
Hmm, is the 3d printing a school one too?
I remember someone was showing me they did that one.
can’t remember though.
that’s what I’m confused abt - why are not all the GRAP ones school electives (like my one)
all well you’ve got some backups at least.
yeah (weirdly)
but i guess it doesn’t count bc it was under school of ID.
ah it arch & design too 😟.
*it is.
someone thought it was a good idea to include fashion design, architecture, and a single graphic design course under GRAP 😑.
😓.
i thought 9? not actually sure.
when did timetabling open?
hmm it might be 8 then haha.
checking noe.
“For programs starting in 2018, the enrolment period is from Wednesday 8 November until 5pm Monday 18 December 2017.”.
Nothing 😣.
Ill do 8 just incase.
yeah tru.
did you hear how that’s changing next year?
no longer first come first serve.
1 sec.
so apparently they take everyone’s ‘ideal’ timetable and try to fit that as best they can.
I think we can review and change it though.
exactly.
😅.
anyway g night i better nod off if i want to wake up tomorrow hehe.
😘.
can’t enrol in more than 3 per term 😟 - chose brand narrative s1 and artists books s2 👍.
hopefully won’t fill up in the next few days if i decide to change.
Nice!
Photojournalism should be a good one ⭐️.
Ok thanks!

Hey was just wondering do dinkums use their inkjet for A4, or is it just for large scale prints.
Was thinking of trying something using inkjet - otherwise I can use my home one.
Printed, look great!
YeAh I'm just going to go past rmit library and then I'll head home.
😱.
Wait what happened?
Lol how vague.

The London studio had a little room upstairs also - Nichol's was quite cool.
They had their sko's , but they were like summaries of their experience/feelings of the trip.
He made an installation of his desk and a video of theit journey.
Are you free tomorrow? I feel like we didn't get much of a chance to chat today 😊.
That's ok, I think I'm free during the day. We have friends over for dinner though.
Hehe what have you unleashed 😜.

Yes I am, although I might be going present shopping w kaity and Tristan around 4:30.
But I'm free before that (and you can come join us ofc)
Yeah that's good!
Is the city alright?
Or did you want to go somewhere else?
Well we were going to go to third drawer down for the gift but I've got to go through the city anyway to get there.
Yeah sounds good.
We can picnic somewhere else if you want, it just might be easier to meet at city.
❤️❤️❤️.
12:30? 😁.
That's ok, it's your turn to be late haha.
I'm at melb uni atm.

(went shopping for Sophia w Tristan today, I think we did quite well 😘)
Yes we did - only got one thing from there though.
It was all a little too "art mom" I think?
Are you able to bring that lovely muji picnic basket on Friday? We wanted something to put them in bc it's just bits and bobs.
Otherwise I'll try and find a nice box.
Actually I might already have something ... I'll let you know.

Hey you left your umbrella I'll take it home and bring it next time😘.

How come? 💕.
Haha yes I would be honoured to grace lupi's kingdom 😘.
Can't wait! ☺️❤️.
(sent with Loud Effect)
Hey 💕 are you free tomorrow?
Oh yeah, white mojo was it?
I don't mind either way, whatever you're in the mood for! ⭐️.
👌.
We'll say 12:30?
Yep!
Didn't want to end up with your run of the mill gold and black, cursive font invite. Tried to make it feel a little traditional without being overly serious, so thought that serif was a nice fit. Knew it couldn't be too playful but it needed a bit of something to give it some life.
Was messing about with the grid system and ended up with the geometric pattern, funnily enough it reminded me both of garden pickets/lattices and the tiles in their house and at dromana. But obviously it's not meant to represent either necessarily.
Originally had a light blue but dad (rightly) felt it looked to plain. Also a bit too Greek haha. So changed to red, was aiming for a more wine-like colour but printed too dull.
Haha enjoy my rationale 😛.
The italics? I thought they may have added a bit of clarity.
Ah sorry still in Carlton atm, wait inside!!
😵.
Daniel wants to go see the disaster artist, are you game?
Like obv I'm worried it might ruin the room for me but I'm also too curious.
Sorry! 💕.
He'll look up session times later today.
So not sure. Obviously can't do Thursday night bc of Ariel Pink 🌸.
!!
Thursday I've got it in my calendar??!
Wait no.
HAHAHAHA.
Why did I think Thursday.
Yeah.
All g.
What time did you want to meet then lol?
Oh yeah.
Here!
Yeah if you want, so 6:30?
Yeah that works.
Yep that's fine.
Hehe abrubt goodbye 👋😚✨.
In Brunswick rn do soon.
You have the tickets right?
Nvm I've got an email copy.
Aha that's ok, I think I'll be early for once though lol.
How late do you think you'll be ? Enough time for dinner?
👌.
If I get takeaway we should be ok haha.
Otherwise might be a bit tight.
Ok! What do you feel like? I'll get it before you arrive.
Just to save us walking around/ not being able to decide etc.
Was feeling like Vietnamese at first.
They have quite a hearty noodle salad bowl with chicken or meat etc.
But up to you I could go for anything really.
Except like, hot soup.
Haha.
￼Bqq chicken.
They also have similar on rice.
👌✨.
They ran out of mango so I got you a lemon crush is that ok?
Nw, I'll head to Flinders when I get it so we should get around the same time.
Perfect.
Hey where in fitzroy are we going tomorrow afterward s?
Ella can't make it to brunch but she might meet up after if it's closer.
Oh ok haha.
Do you know the name of the park or the bookstore?
Just asking now - she said Brunswick St haha.
At the melb exhibition building?
Oh ok thought you had something in mind. If we're just going to be in the city that's easy.
Actually it'll just be in the city, I think she wants to go to exhibition garden's.
Coming from the top of the city on swanston st.
Still waiting haven't left.
Idk what time this is happening so maybe just come in at 12?
I'll meet you halfway somewhere haha.
Isn't the recital hall near the arts centre?
At swanston/bourke St atm.
On my way back.
Hey (if you're still up ☺️) come into the city around 12 we'll be around just hanging - nothing major - so we can stay a bit then run off haha 😛😘⭐️.

Ran to the bus stop but turns out it's late anyway 😓.
It's ok, bus stop said 12:30 but ptv online said 12:20. Just got on now.
Which entrance are we meeting at? The main gallery? Bc I get off at Manningham rd.
I think outside the gallery is best, I can find that easier ⭐️.
❤️.
I didn't bring tissues... Did u? 😅 have my tablets tho.

Hey briggie hope you had a wonderfull birthday today!! Enjoy the rest of the day and we'll see you all soon❤️⭐️🎂🎉🎉✨.
Yes our sweet Zac was dealing the goods 😦.
It was actually alright, they didn't take the piss out of it or play it too broad for laughs.
Dave Franco with his beard was a spitting image of Greg.
Yeah it wasn't a cinema necessary film.
Loved an image.
Laughed at “Lupi is in fact a brioche bun”.
Aww what a delicious sweetie.
Not allocated so I'll buy three ($14.50 each) then if Dan is free we can buy separately or at the box office.
Bought the tickets for radiance. For the other one I got 3 bc Dan isn't sure if he's free or not.
Not allocated so we can buy another later.
Hehe yes same!!
I think I said I'd pay for your radiance ticket, but love and Other cults was $14.50 each.
Yeah no problem.

Just being conservative haha, esp considering the traffic in the city 😅.
Where are you at?
Oh!
Haha warrandyte bus pulling though.
Smart ⚡️.
Hmm should have gotten parents to take me to station 🤔.
Ella is almost there so whenever you're ready head down. ✨.
Unfortunately 😞.
Told kat you're near so hopefully she'll be there soon.
No no, then we'll both be very late haha.
Good choice.
Tram tracker app says I'll get to Flinders at 1.35 but I don't trust it.
Surely I'll make it haha.
Just like the good ol days.
Should've just left it, now we got to deal with a massive wound.
Instead of a bulging , glistening white head.
Making pretty good time actually ❤️.
At MC so maybe 10 mins away? Kat said Dan is on his way.
Ella and I are waiting in the lobby.
Taking the train back home, can you pick me up from station?
I'll message when I'm nearing Coburg.
No stress, wouldn't want you all cold and alone waiting for your bus ⛄️☔️☺️.
Have a safe trip and I'll see u tomorrow😘.
Is a bit delayed, leaves at 6.40 so I should be there around 7.15.
Ok, still haven't left City so I'll be about 30 mins.
😍.
Woah. You kat and Indra should start a gang ⚡️.
Sophia Tristan and I are going to some design market at 3:30. When did you want to meet up?
Movie is at 6:30.
I'm happier to meet earlier if you want.
You can come to this thing if you want but am thinking you won't make it in time.
Ok then, see you at 5! ☺️.
Am out sorry.

By the fountain.
That's ok we were all late.
Looking for tristan but apparently his phone is flat 😂.

Tristan was thinking Thursday for the movie night.

I don't need to work the whole day ❤️.
Yeah let's do that.
Hmm 2?
Yeah on my way back.
At worj.
Haven't asked her yet I'll ask today.
Was it Monday Tues wed next week?
Yeah I'll be home tonight.
Ok ill let you know.
What time are people coming over for the reunion next week? its the 14th right?
Daniel has these tickets for a movie at 3.50 and the person he was going with can’t make it anymore.
I probably can’t go with him but just wanted to check.
Oh I had it on the 14th for some reason.
We don't have anything on the 14th do we?
Oh ok.
In the city.
It finishes at 6.40.
That's ok.
haven’t tried this, but maybe this’ll work for RMIT printing??
Tried it twice now, can't seem to get it to connect 😐.
Might be for an older version.
I'm at the Brunswick campus right now, it's near where site works is.
Yeah sorry I've just got to tweak this one thing.
I know, but I found that site via another one that had it working on Mac.
It works, bc it's just a Java app. But my computer couldn't find the printer.
It's just a .Sh file and a bunch of Java files.
I found another one that's an .App but same problem 😞.
Yeah the printer address they suggest didn't work.
You just search for the driver it's on apples servers.
Probs automated.
Also what time did you want us over for Thurs? Ella kind of has to leave by 11 to catch her bus home (sorry)
On My way back now.
7:30 on Thursday?
He says we'll start at 8, should finish by 10.
He says no.
this is the board.
for Orenda.
Scandi-Pop?
Kmart Chic?
Minimal Memphis?
yes! that’s one of the ones she brought along.
but yes it is a bit cutesy.
Mogwai might be cool, I'll see abt Moses Sumney (I should tally up how much this is gonna cost lol)
I'd like to see RTJ but I know I'll be in dromana then.
Hey re The Internet, I'm happy to pay for your ticket even if you can't pay me back right away.
I'll get paid from rmit in the next couple of weeks so it's ok.
Aw, so sweet ☺️.
Haircut time?!?! 😁.
Exciting ⚡️.
Not sure, getting antsy bc they've been out for a while but have yet to sell out.

Where are you at?
Cool, ioo meet you downstairs?
In the lobby.

We should squat in one hehe.
There was a congregation of skater bois while I was waiting for my tram...
... then all of a sudden they raced off together.
On a mission.
To break some hearts 💔.
That they'll sell out soon.
Ok, I don't mind waiting until next week if that makes it easier for you.
Tbh I haven't listened to them, heresy I know.
Very proud 👏.
Let's say 12:30?

Does he like art and that sort of thing or will it just bore him to death?
Yep! Was thinking we can pop into this place :

No that's ok, idk I always have the same problem when organising a get-together w high school friends.
Melbourne isn't a super fun activity place lol.

Properly.
Ok! I'll have to ask idk what my parents will say haha.

Silly question but they'll ask me, would I be Gemma's trundle bed, or in your bed, or in a spare room?
Ideally to spend the night with you would be nice 🌙.

No 5:45 is good, in case I'm late.
Sandy's friend Camille, from the performance, just popped in to work? Very interesting...
I thought she was at melbourne though.

During the day is good!
👌.
My parents said yes to me coming over Saturday.
We can figure out specifics tomorrow?
Hey I was wondering if you and James were free Friday night, did you want to do something? I'm going away after Christmas so it'll be our last chance for a few weeks.
Ok, I'm not sure how long I can stay though.
Actually it's almost 2 now and most people aren't back from lunch yet, so I should be able to get out without getting more work thrown at me haha.
No I haven't had a break yet, worked through lunch otherwise I'd have to put two breaks.
Yeah that's what I meant, ate at the desk.
Iced please.
Coming now.
Glasses have arrived, pickigg them up tomorrow.
Loved an image.
Ok! Ella is free also.
Tram is soo backed up, been waiting forever.
Hey sorry I'm fine was in the office for the rest of the day.
Sorry left my phone in my room we have guests over.
Sorry yeah was in the office the whole day aside from visit to yours.
Sorry left my phone in my room we have guests over and had to help mum.
Didn't even hear about the accident umtill I got home.
Didn't hear abt the incident until I got home, explains why trams were late ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.
Sorry for doing that to you.
The group chat was blowing up bc I didn't respond.
HAHAHAHA.
Go offline for a couple hours and your dead.
I sent a text to Tristan, must've been around the time of the accident so he said I must be ok.
It's so funny. Sweet, but funny.
No it's ok!
I had a laundry list of notifications and I saw you called so I was worried that you thought the worst for me.
😘.
Sorry for doing that to you.
No one is dead yet, from my understanding.
... is he licking himself?
Ah yes, very comfy. ❤️.
Oh forgot to mention, Tristan is free tomorrow night so something might happen.
Still need to sort it out haha.
I'll keep u in the loop 💕.
Sorry he just said both he and James are free tonight so I'll ask him now.
Was in the middle of a thing sorry.
Great! Ella's keen to just play a board Game or two, nothing major - what time were you thinking?
That's ok, don't stress about the cookies.
As soon as he replies I'll let you know.
Do I need the Medicare cards to pick up my glasses?
I didn't bring it.
Good.
Yeah I'll ask her what time she had to leave, she might be having her mum pick her up.
But 7 is good.
What time wkuld you have to leave Tristan's to get home?
He suggested 7pm.
Like 11pm?
I won't be able to get there before 7, got my haircut at 5:45.
Yep!
How about we meet at 7?
He isn't far away.
Yeah she'll have to leave by 11.
Yeah of course.
No point me hanging around.
I'll take you to your bus then catch my tram home, it'll still be running by then.
Very sweet of you 💕.
I'm still at work just about everyone has left early haha.
Only 3 of us left lol.
True.
However one *is* the project manager so idk.
Oh that's a shame 😕.
Don't stress too much if you can't find anything, he doesn't mind!!

Ended up leaving work early.
Same.
Whatevers easier, I'll leave with her either way.
We're just happy to come over to your's if thats fine.
Yeah nah Ella's a fair hike 🤣 it would be nice to have you people over but my parents won't be too keen on the short notice haha.
I think I'll be eating at home, have to work out my timing bc ive got a hair appointment before woops. I can get some cider or something dw about that.
Yeah sorry, I should organise to invite everyone over some time instead of being rude and inviting myself to your places 😜.
And yeah dw about cooking for us, Ella and I will eat before hand.
Ok so I'll meet you in the city around 7. I've already eaten so I'll head out once I'm done at the hairdresser's.

I suppose so.
Sorry just finished now! They were running late.
I'm in Brunswick so I won't be too long.
Yeah.
No that's closed thus week haha.

I would not mind either, although I don't want to make your family feel like I am avoiding them!
Om my way!
On the bus! Did a big ol wave hah.
No, the bus.
Remember last time?
AHHAHA.
He was upset bc I didn't wave him down soon enough.
So he almost drovepast.
He said there's like 6 busses that go past at that stop, so I guess they don't want to stop for someone who isn't waitingfor them?
He was very grumpy though.
(bit then why wait by the side of road if you're not catching that bus)
Hehe yes same.
2:35 ish?
I'll share my location again when close 😙.
Here!
All good here, met the parents and everything. Ella and I had fish and chips for dinner we went to the river trail.
Ok, I think Ella's mum wanted to drive me back.
But I'll let you know.
All good here, ill let you know when I'm going to head back. It'll probably be around 3 or 4.
Coming back now.
Thank you for dropping me off!
Now it's my parents who are embarrassed for not inviting you in!!
Hehe.
Tell your parents thank you very much for the oil and the card - she's heard good things about Tony from Keillor 😉!!
Thank you again for the gifts, and a lovely christmas eve-eve 😙.
Oh wow.

Merry Christmas beautiful 😘🎄🎁🎅.
Have a swell day with your family 💕.

Laughed at an image.
Just arrived in dromana - guess who drove.
1 more hour down!
Tyty.
the one on the right is okay.
28 is fine.
Sure.
Line should be ok - i think i have to redownload it though.
Internet is very slow here so may take some time.
Test.
Testing.
Sent a text, did it work?
Wait, ofc not - you haven't put it in yet! My mistake.
I'll just wait until line finishes downloading.
Nothing much yet, but about to head to the beach now!
Loved “have fun! 🌊🏄”.
What time did you ask Nonna to take out the potatoes?
Hey Nat, can you ask Zia cat and my mum when the potatoes should go in? Thank you!
Never mind, we'll put them in around 6.
No that's ok, we figured it out haha! Thanks anyway!
It's All fine brigi I can reach the power button from the back seat haha.
Crisis averted.
If Sophia feels like anything let me know!
Ok.
Hey I'm back in Melbourne for a couple days, you free sometime tomorrow to catch up quickly?
Hey Briggi yeah sure that sounds good. Ive got those notes we wrote the other day, it wasnt much but I can add those in as well.
Thanks Brigette looks good.
I would have to try it on.
It's ok.
Prefer the white onr.
No not that one.
Ok.
I'm almost at harding St now.
So probably not.
That's ok, tomorrow is difficult bc I have my Nonna's birthday at night. I'll see you when I'm back again.
Glad it went down well, here you go!
Done.
Yeah I'll be home I think, if the rain eases up.
I'll be home tomorrow night, meeting Ella during the day through.
Thanks!
No you can put it away I'll hear it up when I get back.
He looks so pleased to see you again!
For some reason I get two message chats,.
This one and your Gmail.
It's Kaitlyn. Your cat is adorable and I love him.
☺️✨❤️.
￼They were like, what's this all about adrian.
😘😘😘.
So I'll see you tomorrow? Let's say 1?
Outside state library, then we can head to a cafe or something.
💕☺️😗.
And me you! ❣️.
Yeah was just about to haha be home soon.
I'm on my way! Follow my Uber trip:
Safe and sound!
You two ok?
Mmmm home away from home.
Ahh sorry good morning 😝.
😘 did you get any sleep?
☹️.
Ah that's ok then I guess.
That place you sent me looks cute!
Was abt to say.
Yeah got to shower first but I think I can make it but 12:30?
Otherwise we'll save it for another time.
Any other places you got saved?
That's ok we can go there.
Probably. I have to take the Elizabeth St tram today bc there's works along lygon st.
So maybe we can meet at fed sqr and then walk down?
Yes!
✨.
If that's ok with you?
See you soon mon ami ☺️.
Wow look at that wide open road!
Hmm very strange.
Hmm.
Not very comforting lol.
There's a bit of traffic along Sydney Rd I think I'm going to be a bit late btw 😕.
No I'm still in Brunswick!!
You'll be waiting too long haha.
Wait inside somewhere sorry.
Ughhh it's so sloww.
Was going to hop out and take an uber but it's still gonna be 25 mins.
Yeah I don't think I can make it in time😫😫😫.
I'm so sorry!! 😭.
Going to get an uber it's just ridiculous.
No that bit is all closed off atm - tram works.
Maybe we can go to market Lane? That's near Elizabeth St?
Yeah.
Is that ok.
It's Hoddle, lygon St too.
It's All a mess atm.
No, I think lygon St opens again sometime this week tho.
Actually should have gotten the train like you, silly me.
Ok just hopped in the uber now.
Skateboards are moving faster lil.
Bad decision me shoulda heeded your advice sorry.
Yeah.
I was near a station but now it seems a bit rude ahhhhh.
Oh that's good! Everyone must be in Brunswick then haha.
I'm quite close.
Where are you, in the cage?
Cafe.
I see u.
What time are you leaving to go to the restaurant?
Ok, I think I should be able to get back home by then. Unless I meet you halfway?
On high Street? Would that be ok?
Traffic on the way up was very busy on Sydney Rd that's all.
Did you find it?
Yeah I'll catch it at 5:30 and get there at 6:11.
A lot of traffic, just left collingwood.
Ok good.
Arrived but parents haven't even left yet hehe.
How is your trip home going?
Waiting in Darebin Rd by the mechanic.
Make sure you get a nice good sleep 😴😊.
Delayed reaction.
Hey is everything all g for kelela tomorrow night? @8 I think.
Hmm I finish work at around 5, I think I might just stay in the city rather than head home and back.
Would you want to get dinner beforehand with me?
Even 5:30 or 6 is good, I don't mind waiting.
LMK.
(couldnt help myself)
Oh no!
Lather up in aloe.
oh poor thing 😟 hope it heals up today.
Last night somebody broke into the office here.
He got caught while he was escaping.
... and he broke his leg as he ran away in the fire escape.
It’s so bizarre, I walked in this morning and there was stuff everywhere. bc he was riffling through the drawers and stuff.
nothing important stolen thankfully.
No I wasn’t haha.
got in around 9.
I just thought someone was doing a spring clean at first.
yes, same. He’s in the hospital now.
hehe.
Ok sounds good.
Yep sorry just had to print off one last thing I'll be there soon.
Ok.
Oh I just have to go past my dads work for a sec, I left work a bit later than 5 sorry.
I'll be near rmit, did you want to meet me at the state library?
Here now, wbu?
Cu.
Kelela was so so so good, was amazing ❤️.
And how are your legs feeling?
😝😘.
Just waiting on the Sydney Rd tram.
Oh no!! That's awful, kisses to make them feel better 😗😗😗.
That's ok don't worry abt tomorrow night, I just want you to recover.
Oh earlier than expected, yay!!
all well, hope you enjoy this course more than the other one!
(also was going to mention this yesterday but completely forgot abt it, but our office was broken into sunday night lol)
(security caught him, he tried escaping through the fire escape but broke his leg HAHA)
just some reassurance abt the ‘quality’ of security before you start eh.
look i don’t think we even know his motives. There was a bit of cash stored (couple thousand?) but he just pilfered through all the drawers. There was a few bottles of alcohol, i think he was going to grab some iPads and a laptop?
oh and he opened a bottle of soy sauce, so presumably he had a midnight snack while he was here.
Nah he’s in hospital now.
Also fyi RMIT is doing this new preferential timetabling system this year, instead of the usual first-come-first-serve style one.
I think Monash does this new style? They’ll tell you about it anyway but just a heads up.
Yes and no,.
If you're trying to get all you classes in 2/3 days then it's a bit harder to get what you want now.
Bc they take everyone's submitted 'ideal' timetable then try to fufil that for as many people as possible.
But apparently it always deviates quite a bit. Then there's another round where you can swap and edit your classes.
But now I guess the servers won't crash under this new system?
Since you don't have a mad rush at 9am sharp.
Haha oh dear.
I don't mind the sound of it tbh, my friend who explained was rather skeptical that's all.
I think with the swapping period it would be fine.
How are you feeling today? 💙.
Glad to hear!
No thankfully!
Security team must have been awake this tome.
Got a seat outside.
￼Meme for today.
Very welcome.
So do you think I'll be able to see you tomorrow night? ✨.
We can get dinner ❤️.
Oh dear 😨 is it the grass allergies then?
That doesn't sound good ☹️ let me know how you go but don't stress if you haven't recovered by tomorrow.
Hmm, who'd have thought!
Sending virtual kisses to speed up the process xxx.
Coming down now.
Outside.
Yeah in the car with dad.
Wwe're still on royal parade, about half and hour still.
Just at mass's, tech support.
omg  lol.
Oh good, I'm glad 😊.
Sweet dreams 😘✨.
I'll probably finish around 5?
So sometime around then would be great ❤️.
Are you feeling better today? ☺️.
Ohhh poor thing 😣.
What do you feel like for dinner?!
Hmm, I had pizza on the weekend. Let's do Vietnamese!
Not sold out!! Yay!!
I’ll see if Kat is able to come now too.
oh wait - Android doesn’t do iMessage lol.
Check your fb!
Getting dinner with Ella tonight so I'll be home later.
Seeing Ella after work so I'll be home later.
Sure thing.
Lol.
Yeah it's not so great.
Did you put sunscreen on?!
👍✨.
ok, I’ll meet you near qv?
Heading to qv now.
Repulse and amuse is what I do 👉👉.
In my natural habitat as always.
Bloody art hoes.
￼The pool!
Coming back now.
HEY would you want to go see king krule they just added a second show ✨.
Its On sale tomorrow morning.
Is this Sandy's dog?!
Oh.
Still, exciting!
😘.
Miss you already 😔.
Loved “*Sending you a magical kiss thru the air*”.
Woops.
Tap with two fingers to kiss.
Lol.
Hehe.
Yess ok fantastic!
Lol u working now mrs money bags over here.
Ok yeah I was going to suggest I buy all three together just in case.
Still better than no job at least.
Hmm not sure, Ella used to like him idk how she feels abt him now.
Maaybe Tristan idk.
I can ask them.
So did you want me to buy indra's as well? Idm it'll prob be easier in one go.
Hey I'm going to buy tickets for kat and me to see king krule tomorrow bc she's busy working, did you want me to get yours too? 🐸🎟.
It might be safer to just buy them in one go is all.
Yeah it's at the croxton I think 👍👍✨.
Sweet sounds good 👉👉.
Hey I'm buying tickets to see king krule with kat and Indra tomorrow morning, do you still like him?
Ah that's ok. Also we're going to Tristan's on sat night, don't know any other details but I'll let you know.
And Sophia wanted to meet up tomorrow night, just something chill, did you want to come?
😘✨.
Yeah just organising it now.
How was your day are tour legs feeling better?
Yeah cool just checked buying for the three of us 👍.
Also asked Ella too but she said nah hasn't been paying attention to him.
It's ok we still have to organise an art hoe picnic with us all.
Yay 😊.
Do anything interesting today?
Hmm, well it's interesting to me!
Prismacolours? Oh nice, I've never actually used them irl but I've heard they are the ✨Top choice✨.
True to name.
I think there are other derwents that are a bit better, ironic that the shitty ones are the "artist" ones tho.
It's $57.
Your bank transfer comments are a wild ride.
Tytyt 💸.
7.30 tomorrow night?
Stuart would be very proud.
Oh yeah I need to look at mine haha.
And studio balloting too I think?
I think?
She said we'll go to a bar or something but just meet me at our usual spot 😘.
Also Tristan told me that data vis clashes with our core comms class?! But he said something abt them changing it bc there's quite a few of us in it lol.
I have to get some more info but I'll keep you posted.
I might send an email tomorrow too try and clear it up.
I can't be arsed trying to find a replacement , there wasn't anything else goood!!
The New timetable method? Yeah no we don't really have any control over it 😤.
Yeah really didn't get much out of our classes last sem.
Love chris but it was only like 2 weeks of actual content.
Yeah I can't really believe this is third year like wtf what have I even been taught.
Tbh I think clusterfuck is just rmit's policy.
Oml HAHAHA.
It's pretty good, just a lot of postcards and flyers atm.
Making some weird basardisation of the brand but it's ok.
Nah I wouldnt put much in, not online at least.
Maybe in an interview I'd have a short section sampling some stuff to show working to Brand guides and for an event, it depends.
Who it is I guess.
I'll subtly use the versions three revisions back before they made change to colours and squeeze more text in lol.
Anyway I can't complain.
Inner City cushy design slut haha.
You know me better than myself.
ALSO someone at work told me rmit staff can get cc for $12 a month like where was this info b4?!?
There was some website hold on lemme find it.
Haven't looked into it yet.
The eternal struggle.
Yeah! She came back last sat, she's been good ✨.
Yeah I'm down for that, when is it?
💔.
Savage.
No she mustve missed it.
Yeah ive been looking forward to seeing it, I can't do this weekend though, maybe next week?
Is it on during the week or just weekends?
Good lord.
She is great.
Nvm it's on all week.
Yeah just let me know what night suits you.
Maaybe? We might be going back to the beach for the long weekend but I'm not sure what's happening.
Right right.
Hmm.
I'll go find my parents and ask what's going on lol hold up.
Yeah 25th is good if you don't mind!
Atm I'm free at night during the week, just working durig the day.
Ok false alarm we're not going.
So am free closing night too.
Cool cool we'll see what kat and ella can do.
Eh it's ok I think I will survive.
Night gorgeous ❤️.
￼New aesthetic?
Also re. Timetable.  Turns out it's bc myTimetable is stupid.
Data Vis is on Monday Arvo, and our core class is either Monday or Wednesday. But they've miss tagged it so it looks like we have two classes for it, instead of just one.
So in other words it won't clash.
Was going to say more of a regular picnic but at the Heidi gallery, but sure why not.
I think they are Mexican wrestling masks actually? Just as confusing.
Yeah nw praying it works 🙏🙏🙏.
got em! $57.
I sent the pdf on fb messenger are you still on there?
Is Anthony's thing this Saturday? What time is it?
Ok, I was going to meet some friends after the dinner then.
So it'll be done by around 7:30/8:00 do you think?
Cool, easy 👍.
Hey sorry I made a big mistake this morning.
Sweet.
Did you get a message from Kay?
Also don't make my mistake, he's only told Tristan Elly and me abt the pronouns so unless it's just them use she/her.
I just feel like I betrayed his trust now, like he trusted and felt comfortable enough with me to tell me and then I fucked it up. He says he's ok now that he knows what I meant.
But like I feel so stressed about what I did I can't imagine what he must've gone through.
It's ok don't mean to drag you into this.
I'm just a bit panicked atm he has forgiven my blunder.
I love you too thanks for being considerate.
How's the message going?
Yeah sure thing.
It doesn't have to be anything oscar worthy haha just short and reassuring.
*before you were ready to come out to me.
(Cis-white men ugh, am I right?!)
Too jokey to add that in ahah??
Nvm.
I think it's good otherwise, it's not ott and its reassuring.
No that's fine, I've apologised profusely on fb haha and was going to get him a little card or something.
I hope so.
I Wonder where I can get like a Trans coming out card?
Like a tasteful one.
A riso one.
Perhaps.
I think I'll go past readings during lunch get a nice illustration one.
Damn I think you're onto something here.
None of my uni friends can be arsed going out to Reservoir 😤 I asked Adam tho and he said sure why not.
I thought we were going to do it at your house? But we can do it elsewhere if you want.
You didn't say.
Where were you thinking?
How are you going to heat up the lasagna tho, won't you need an oven?
Yeah at your house.
But if we go elsewhere like in a park or whatever what were you going to do?
Anyway adam can drive unlike the rest of us so we can get to your place easily.
Yes.
And probably life threatening.
Sophia says that you can start at hers tonight if you want, instead of having to take the bus back.
Oh I don't think she's coming Saturday night.
😬.
Maybe you can stay here? We can set you up in the Pull out couch?
No that's so far!!
I'd have to ask.
Haha no dont do that.
I mean I could ask Sophia it you can stay at hers tomorrow night buy bc she isn't going to Tristan's it would be weird?
But I'll ask my parents anyway.
They're not coming down from the beach tonight are they?
As well.
Oh I'd like to go home with you but I'm not sure if my parents will feel any less uncomfortable by that haha.
I'm sure they'll let you stay in the spare room.
What should I ask ahaha.
Ok ill ask them once we finish dinner.
It's... Not nice today.
No!?
Oh dear.
What now?
Should I tell Sophia to meet us at a later time?
Ok I asked them they're happy to have you over.
Dad just has to get rid of all his paper work in the room haha.
Sure.
I'm going w shorts.
For me.
Twins.
Melbourne has taught u well.
Just going past Melb uni now! Wait for me inside qv.
Ok I won't be long sorry!
Just heading past rmit now so you might get there before us.
We're are you now we're just at qv.
Ok we'll head to the bar.
Just waiting on some seats.
Ella is keen to go the the trienial either day works.
Omg I'm at a bat yung atty is the bartender.
Some hipster ass place in China town.
Terrible.
Yeah and ella.
Hmm I didnt see any crates.
Union electric.
He gave us a menu it was busy so we left.
Yep it is.
Yeah it's bloody confusing. I don't think we timetable for semester 2 though.
At work I over heard them say we don't.
The call centre is in my office.
Idk don't take my word.
Try and do both.
All g.
Safe travels! ✨❤️.
Kisses beautiful 😘.
Walking down the street now, good night!
Haha ofct.
Thanks for coming out.
￼Lol wat.
(I know why it happens it's just so funny to me)
Let's say around 7? I have to double check what time the dinner is tho.
Hmm maybe 7:30.
Dinner is at Docklands unfortunately, the tram nearby goes along Collins St...
Maybe just Melb Central.
I told Tristan that we'd get some snacks and drinks.
Or qv.
Yeah let's.
See you! I'll let you know later on if we need to meet later.
Haha I will try 😴.
God old straight men are so boring.
Haha ty we're playing lawn bowls now lol.
Sure ok thank you!!
Oh uh ok if you want! I'm not sure what time we'll finish dinner, we're still at bowls club.
I'll let you know when we go for dinner, if you want to leave for the city then?
Ah ok.
Yeah eat. Just got told about 10 mins here. Sooo should be done by 7.45?? I'll leave as soon as I can.
Haha sorry it's so vague.
If you want to go to Tristan's earlier you can, James will be there till 8, Kay is coming later too like me.
I'll let him know.
If you want.
Ok! Whatever you prefer.
Lifeless and SO thicc 👅👅👅.
Ok we just arrived at the restaurant, and actually it's in China town so it's a bit closer. How are you doing?
Classic.
😘.
Sorry bad reception in here.
Food still hasn't arrived unfortunately.
Maybe just some ciders , James will be staying now haha.
Hey I'm almost done here where are you now?
Ok I'm in Chinatown so I'll head up to find you. I'll get you know when I'm near.
Coming up Russell st now.
Meet you near your bus stop.
We are ok our way back now, taking an uber.
Ok thanks, that should be fine.
😘.
Good morning! Are you awake?
Lol such a busy kat.
Well Ella is free either night!
HAHA.
She's been robbed of her independence now poor girl.
You're welcome! Anytime ❤️.
How is lupi more importantly?
Ah very good 😻.
Ahh so brave 💕.
(sent with Gentle Effect)
Don't feel bad!
😨.
Warrandyte sure is dangerous.
Oh, the studio?!!
You can't seem to catch a break.
Yeah I'm looking at it now.
It's sounds like they got the memo about not enough folio work haha.
I've just read the first para let me see...
Hmm it actually looks really good.
Like if they took brief Sabbatical but added more "practicality".
I think you'd like it a lot actually.
Me too!!
Oh so they stuffed up the expertise class on myTimetable. It's listed as a Prac and a Studio, but it's all the same thing we just enroll in one.
So there's 8 classes.
But two have been listed incorrectly.
I have no clue why this problem hasn't been fixed yet, but they explained on our FB group.
Ah ok, I have to do one of the monday ones bc my elective is on Monday.
Shit yeah haha.
I'm doing a Wednesday class.
Yes of course!
Is your elective on Wednesday.
?
What time?
Ok well I'll just catch up with you after it hehe.
Also the 5.30 Monday lecturers are still on, they just hid it in the studio timetables.
My elective actually goes into it by an hour oh well.
Ikr.
Haha yes perhaps, destiny.
Yeah I'm thinking.
Don't mind missing a bit of them.
...Or if they are recorded again 🤔.
Hopefully!
Never ended up watching the one I missed so good track record Adrian 😜.
Hey what time do you think you'll be back?
Nvm trams are running again there was an accident earlier.
That's alright, quickly realised my mistake.
This new timetable is a clusterfuck, fb group is going off.
I did the same thing, can't get rid of it now 😣.
Suzie posted to say Neil and Toni are in today, maybe they'll finally fix it.
I'm just going to wait and see.
Hmm, interesting.
Can't remember if my intensive was in the timetable, I think we may have just gotten and email telling us.
Email the coordinator?
But some people's classes havent even been added into myTimetable yet.
Sophia is doing a VE class, and they still have the old system - but the lec was like "oh I'll add it Monday!".
So she has no idea if she can even do this course let alone when it is.
Renae is doing it too, but nobody knows if they'll get the right credits for it.
Everyone is still on holidays it seems.
Business skills go out creativey.
For.
Business skills for creatives.
Sorry was walking and one hand free.
HAHA.
that sounds fun.
hmm, they show you the percentage of which people picked which class, handy.
Also semester 2 is read only, so i guess that settles whether or not we have to do it.
no studio email yet?
me either dw.
it’ll prob come later today.
once our lecturers wake up from their lazy holiday slumbers.
Yeah just got in now.
😗u2!
rmit student life got a prelim version of their brand this morning...
.... and it’s a bit shit.
like a real phoned-in design.
haha rmit loves to have brands!
bc then it all looks the same as the academic and corporate voices i guess.
I mean it’s very confusing, but i understand why certain programs want to establish a different voice to the rest of rmit.
but yeah it’s probably too much in the long run.
Yeah maybe, where is David Jones again?
I’ll see how I go this afternoon.
I'll leave in abt 10 mins, I need some fresh air anyway.
Ok got it.
Yeah I was going to ask, have to see if she's free Saturday.
Also are we still doing your meal thing tomorrow?
What time did you want to do it?
Oh ok, I just assumed it was during the day but this is better.
See you around then.
I'll ask again but I think sp.
Daniel's dinner thing is tomorrow at 6/6:30, are you free to come?
His possibly poisonous dinner.
(not really he promised he won't)
Ok cool, thank you I need the support.
He said to get there around 6/6.30.
Yeah he'll come.
4 Mia Close.
Reservoir Vic.
Australia.
I mean, sometimes you just don't know!
I should have specified Planet Earth, he often doesn't give that impression but that's where he's from!
Do we need to get tickets in advance for this thing?
Ok sweet.
Morning to my favourite cat 😘.
And owner ofc ❤️.
Hey feel like grabbing another coffe later today? Doesn't have to be for long.
Haha I was thinking around 3?
Or is that a bit late?
Yeah no worries.
Just somewhere nearby, prob pool house again lol.
￼Scavenger maps arrived!
The inside is a bit bleahh bc of all the text and changes I needed, but I'm glad I was able to keep the cover the way it is haha.
Hehe thank u 💕.
Coming out now.
Outside like last time.
Won't be home for dinner I'll be home later tonight.
Ah ok.
Haha all g I feel ya.
It's ok dw.

Whent to Google Steven and typed Stephen Bannon lol.
Wrong nazi woops.
Omg theres a video interview on his site abt it he looks SO 2006.
And sweaty?
I couldn’t finish it lol.

So fuck that sign’s old.
heritage.
“COMPUTERISATION”.
ew i don’t want to give him the satisfaction.
oh god another one.
UM THATS THE POINT.
TEH SIMPLICETY.
No sorry, I’m not really sure who’d to contact abt that. The NAS team dissolved end of last year 😟.
I think property services now handles a lot of the NAS stuff now?
Nah she won’t, I can ask her she’s right here hahah.
yeah not surprised.
What did you want me to ask specifically?
Oh ok sure yeah i can do that.
yeah ok I’ll ask her when she doesn’t look as busy.
she knows you by name yeah?
cool.
“Oh yeah i remember sophia, she’s cool”.
She wasn’t 100% sure, she’s sent me a link for venue hires but I think it might be staff only, try it out anyway.
Otherwise you can try sending an enquiry to venues@rmit.edu.au but idk how quick or nice they’ll be.
She knew the lady who was in charge of RAD last year, but I don’t think she’s doing it anymore?
rachel.yeo@rmit.edu.au.
Maybe mention that you’re with Activator or something?
There’s the “Innovative Design Showcase” in NAS that could be useful, it’s that weird round room opposite campus store.
She wasn’t so sure about the megaflexes.
Otherwise she said email her.
Hey what time are you going to get to Daniels do you think, I'm catching the train bc Im at work currently but I should get there around 6:30.
Mega flexes are the ones near my office, Medibank is in one atm.
They didn't seem to be on that site though when I looked.
She also opened the booking system for the library and study rooms, they could be there?
It was called it bookit I think.
Haha lol I just left right after work. Should have eaten damn.
I'll get something afterwards if I need.
Don't expect anything less.
Ok I'm here finally.
I'm here now are you nearby.
No I'm inside.
Yeah I'm out the front.
Yes I would love to!
￼Mum made some sourdough bread!
She's been trying for a little while, finally got it!!
Yeah definitely! ❤️💕.
What time will you be around?
Let me know and I can leave early.
Yeah it'll be ok.
How are you going?
Did you want to go to very good falafel for dinner? It's open till 10.
No im still busy so take your time.
Ok leaving now where will you be?
Sire.
Sure.
What time tomorrow are we meeting?
8 is fine, I'll just eat at Home 👌.
Yes just told her.
Nah all g I'm spending all of rmit's money on food anyway lol.
Ah sorry forgot to message earlier but I'm getting something to eat with Ella tonight.
I have your tea jam!!
Did you say you'll be in the city during the day tomorrow?
Yes sweet.
Also gives me an excuse to get coffee with you haha.

Not that I believe in such nonsense ofc.
Hehe.
Is that?... Steve Carrel on the front?
Damn guess there are some things you just can't learn at school.
Hmm, fascinating nevertheless.
Well I'm just glad they didn't try to convert you.
The word of good old JC.
Oh yes Mary.
The other one, nit his mum.
Oh I thought it was a conspiracy, as in the davinci code?
The Catholic church didn't want people to know.
For some reason?
Doing God's work.
It was nice seeing Sandy and Raf today, dinner was very cute!
this is perfect.
I think I saw something like that.
Maybe it was a picture.
Ah yes maybe, I have seen that before.
Oh shit I left the tea.

Left it on the countertop to remember it.
Can I bring it on Friday?

Those Bros getting down to boogie.
Hmm well I got up a bit late unfortunately, still got to shower and pack so I think I can get there by 1 if I leave by 12.
Hey sorry just about to leave, parents didn't want me catching all those busses and trams in this heat so had to wait for them.
But I'll catch your bus from Hoddle at 12:57.
She probably won't believe me but you're free to tell her yourself.
Also I told her a bit about your jc trilogy.
On the bus now!! 😗.
Yes I think so, she seemed a bit grossed out by the end however.
Not by anything in particular just it's decline into Middle of The road running out of steam comedy.
I'll try haha.
Sorry I'm so late.
Haha.
Yes off.
❤️.

You can if you all want I'll just have leftovers.
I'm at work today, finish around 5. We can get something to eat if you'd like?
Otherwise I might quickly est at home, but I don't know if I'll have to do that tbh.
That's fine I'll probably won't leave bang on 5 anyway.
Mc is closer.
Haven't left yet so if you go to mc I'll meet you at 5.30.
Or whenever it is you get there.
5.40 ish?
Coming down soon.
Ok! Was thinking either tomorrow or sat.
Tomorrow after work we're saying goodbye to the intern she's invited us to drinks in fitzroy.
So after that?
Is there a later showing?
Hmm ok ill figure it out tomorrow I'm with Adam atm sorry!
Also would you like to come over Saturday during the day? Tristan was thinking of inviting people over sat night so you could come back with me again.
Oh ok yeah whatever you prefer.
It is a pain to lug around.
Idm!
She won't mind! I'll tell her to cook something normal ahaha.
Mate I've been to yours like plenty more times.
But yeah think abt it.
HAHAH HA.
Ok so.
How long do you think your meeting will be ?
I was thinking we could get dinner maybe in fitzroy then go to the Nova to see the movie at 8:30?
I don't think I'll be able to make the 6.00 session.
Hmm no it's about 20-30 mins.
It's 8.35 according to their website.
I'll try not to stay too long with this thing before, depending when we get there I should be out by 6/6.30.

Heading out now sorry.
I found heaven: a pizza place that plays dream pop/shoegaze and who's logo is a flying pig with Lazer eyes.
You're welcome! I'm sorry I'm always making you wait around for me ❤️.
Let me know what time you want to see me tomorrow.
Also what studio?
Hey did you get your first pref?
Yay glad you got it!! Should be ok even without him tho.
I got into Andy's, very excited ⚡️.
Ahah thaa saying something coming from you.
I love being confused, bask in the confusion.
Oh damn.
Pretty good resting state then.
Ella got her first pref too.
It used to be this illustration one, but they changed it to a do-whatever-you-like one.
Similar to what I did first sem last year, but more business focused! It sounds really good.
Yeah she's well known to people who aren't me apparently HAHa.
Yeah easy!
Did you get home alright? Are you feeling a little better?
😃 glad.
Sending you lots of kisses and hugs 😘.
Love you lots, Amore mio 💓.
Fuck it's only like 3 weeks away.
Where did my break go.
Oh I'm not sure if I can come see you anymore tomorrow 😞.
My nonna slipped today and broke her ankle we might be going to see her tomorrow after lunch 🙁.
I'll let you know tomorrow morning, she might not have been discharged by then.
She should be ok, could be much worse. Stuck on crutches for 6 weeks now.

Don't feel bad, it wasn't your fault.
I miss you too, but I get to see you allll next week remember.
I still love you just as much even when you're sad 💕 please don't feel guilty ❤️.
Haha tuff titties there my friend. Did you see Sophia's snap abt Swinburne.
(she's staying, her elective is fine)
Only course I'm not keen on is the core one - it's that 4 weeks of one thing bs.
Don't learn shit from it.
Oh haha fuck true they had it in open day fucking yr 11.
I mean I've always liked what the students do with it but seriously, so many classic Greek texts to pick from.
Lol.
🤷‍♂️.
David has taught you well it seems.
Embrace the unconventional.
Fair fair ill leave you to your walk 👋.
Nnnnnnice.
Would do they dame tho.
Same.
Did you manage to fall asleep?
Hmm.
Spoke to Indra and kat btw, they both got their first prefs.

Very ❤️.
Hasn't been discharged yet, they want to make sure she can use the crutches properly.
How did you go with your lunch date? ❤️.
Feeling better)
?
Ah, yeah you would have needed it.
Yay, wasn't that bad!
Oh ok, Stephen and I just finished the pasta.
How did you want to split it? Yours was only like 6.95.
48.25 in total / 5 of us = 9.65 each. Is that alright?
Yep!
Thanks ☺️.
Oh dear, what a shame 😞.
He looks quite cute tho.
He's so dark!!
Very witchy.
And gangly.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
Haha did you get much more sleep last night?
Oh hmm I guess you're just shifting your sleep schedule around.
Do you get a lunch break? We can meet then.
Yes please! Let me know when it is, I usually break at 12/12:30.
Oh I don't think that's true, he's probably just a bit anxious after today.
He just needs his alone time 😺.
Laughed at “I had a dream last night that Guillermo del Toro asked my dad to build a giant set piece in the desert for his next film. And he wanted it done by December which in the dream was only a few months away.. ”.
So cute 💕.
Not your strangest though, but up there.
Hehe.
HAHa.
Perhaps, but surely he does everything in 3d now so it doesn't take as long.
Oh dear, did he run out of time?
Del Toro's loss.
This is very good 👌.
ooh cool listening now.
they just popped up on my youtube never heard of them before.
Sure do!
I thought it was like dream pop meets Talking Heads, very nice.
The French cheese toastie place has opened...
Yesss!!
Have you started class yet?
Ok cool, tell me when you break for lunch and I'll find you.

She’s doing a summer intensive class this week, she gets a break at 12.30.
outside my office alright? then we can head someplace.
👌.
logged into myTimetable, they finally fixed our core class.
get your back pay first!
then tell him another offer has come up.
lol.
yeah i feel that.
dunno how much *more* social media strategy you’ll learn here (since you’d know more than all of them) but it will be more fulfilling I’d say.
You’d be doing more than posting of.
Not sure, i can ask them when they come in later.
I think it’s more of an offloading role, so some social media, some writing, mail chimp, sorting through cabinets.
haha two mins away.
yeah fair.
Depends on their budgeting, it’ll mean they have to charge you overtime.
so I kind of doubt it.
but i’ll suss it out.
they’re at brunswick today setting up for orientation.
hello 🌙 meet at 12.30 again?
also sophia will join us bc we both forgot we were supposed to get coffee together this morning lol, is that alright?
Meet me outside my office?

He looked like he knew what he was doing, but yes I agree.
Just got a call from the banner place NOW, when I tried to call them and get support at 10:30 this morning.
Already ordered the thing! Don't need your help anymore!

HAHAHA.

Hey I won't be home for dinner tonight.
Hey not only is Lonsdale St closed but Hodfle St is having more work done - delays up to an hour!!
Is there any other way I can get to yours, maybe via the hurstbridge line?
I can take the train to eltham station, then there's a bus to warrandyte.
(or if she's not busy would your mum be so kind as to pick me up from there? Hehe ☺️)
Ok I should get there at 1:15.

Yeah sweet dw.
Glad you finally have a class you like lil.
Laughed at an image.
Ahaha yes I have been hired specially to draw potato men for rmit.
Nice nice typical Liam off holidaying while you do all his work.
Jkhk.
Didn't they switch over to this whole convaluted process so that it's easier for people overseas to use?
Lol you going to get a big boy tat?
The meme u just sent me.
All good here, quiet morning. I think I'll leave after lunch.
Thank you and your dad for driving me all the way back!!
Also wish Gemma a happy birthday for tomorrow, I didnt get to say goodbye.
Woah!! What do you mean, looks fantastic 😋.
That's alright!!
I had just assumed she was going to leave in the morning ahah.
I'll see you soon anyway.
That's good then.
😘mon Cherie.
Want to get coffee today?
Damn, what a shame.
Brandon must be quite saddened.
Lol sorry tagged along with co workers , we can go in the Arvo if you're free?
Ahah it's ok, just finished lunch so I might be free around 2:30.
Sure! If you want.
Where at.
Ok leaving now.
Damn, +$1000 😵.
How much was it at Dinkums)
?
Hmm.
Yeah, I don’t think they do offset but I could be wrong.
Their presses are digital inkjet, that’s all I know.
It depends ahah. I’ve never actually used offset.
It’s got a higher set-up cost.
but per run is cheaper.
Yeah, I have a feeling 300 copies might classify as a ‘short run’ but it’d be good to check it out. It’s higher quality usually.
Nah I just suggested them bc inkjet is sooo much nicer than laser, and they’re green etc.
I don’t know any good offset places unfortunately.
If you go with offset you could do 2 colours, black and something else.
That could be a good middle ground?
Can give it a bit of an ‘arty’ feel maybe?
Hey, if you have a chance today are you able to look at that Film Fatales book and see where it’s printed? Asking for Sophia.
(I think it said where on the last pages)
Ella has this cool zine that a rmit grad (and stuart ofc ) helped design, just asked her to check where it’s printed.
speaking of old mate, maybe email Stuart and see what he suggests?
lol if he suggests Blurb.
ahah the past couple of months have just disappeared.
It’ll be f i n e.
pop some adderall and get to work.
Ads?
Advertisement s?
Oh yeah I think I remember you mentioning wanting to have some advertising space.
Yeah cool.
Dunno if I can offer any expertise lol.
Yeah yeah ofc.
Can't recall.
Looking noe.
Oooh, I'm quite into it.
A bit more *surreal* than usual.
But exciting nevertheless.
Any rationale that starts with "Sooooo" is a good 1.

Can't wait to get an autograph.
Ooh thank you!
How was your day with Gemma?
Documents on Call doesn't sound as sexy of a printing company lol.
Lovely 💕.

Hmm yeah maybe see what Stuart suggests 😆.
Awwwww.
Soft cuddly lupi.
Ahhhh I know man.
Should have invested in Bitcoin when I had the chance.
Whadaya mean you got plenty of time.
New business idea?
Hey, it's a tech company, it's scalable - activator is sure to fund it!
Pretty much aha.

Ikr.
Mine is 1–4 on Wednesday!

An iPhone se.
Odd one out lol.
Why?
Why do you need one?
Immediately thought it must be something dildo related if it's a gift from you.
Yep!
Yay!! 😚💫.
Coming out now.
Ohhhh.
That explains their more pigment-y feel.
Always liked water colour pencils more ahaha.
Brush over the top usually.
Or drawing onto wet paper I think?
‼️☺️🙌.
new 🎶.
oh dear, hope she’s feeling ok!
I’ll have to check what I’m doing sunday.

Trello, GDrive, GSheets mostly.
Mailchimp!
Mail chimp mailchimp mailchimp.

haha.
they prob won’t know what most of those are but very good.
FUCK.
Keyboard and trackpad aren't responsive.
Have to finish this job by tonight lol.
Can't stop.
nah.
Maybe when I reset.
I've been using a mouse from before.
So icsnstill work.
Just no typing!!
hey sorry got stuck at work.
im still in the city.
Sorry just finished at work.
Hey just finished up here, what are you doing?
I was going to head home to eat but if you're around now we can get something in the city.
I'm happy to just go for a drink later tonight, I'll either eat something here and wait for you or go home, eat, then meet you back in they city?
Up to you- both quicker for us to get to than the city yeah?
Yeah yep let's do that.
Ok what time will you get to northcote or Preston do you think?
Ahah sorry only got out of work now.
I think I have to go into the city tomorrow anyway now - my keyboard and trackpad became unresponsive!!
Was going to meet friend after dinner but since I stayed back late I'm just going to stay in the city and eat here.
I'll see you later tonight.
Ok I'll catch the train to Preston station then meet you there?
Or do you prefer northcote?
Ehh let's go with Preston we can head to northcote later if we want.
I'm just hungry atm Ahah.
Cool see you there soon.
Ahaha I wish that was me rn 😚💕.
Same, heading past Collingwood.
Hahah all g.
Nah they won't.
Oh thank God keyboard and trackpad work again.
was with a friend last night so didn't open it after work. Putting it to sleep and waking it probably fixed it aHaha.
Loved “I told u so 😉”.
yay!!
the first chapter in the IT 101 textbook is just that, in giant text.
whats that?
pretty sure you need to complete that in order to work for them.
its like their induction process.
of course, other wise you can’t get hired.
or submit your application.
something like that.
its just a general quiz or something.
no relation to the job - just general rmit stuff.
Its never come up in an interview, my score i mean.
70% is a pass, as long as you pass thats all they need.
they prob cant even see it.
oh hmm.
legit can’t remember what my quiz was like.
ok maybe they do see your answers.
idk i guess you just write about a time that is relevant. if not just make it up and tell them what they want to heat.
hear.
it closes tomorrow doesn’t it?
the 18th.
yeah just write from experience. its my most hated part of interviews too.
i don’t know what else to say ahah i can’t give you answers.
its not like theres some secret key.
did you write a cover letter? Just think of it like that essentially.
you can probably use the same answers.
yeah so write specifically about the examples that you’ve alluded to in the cover letter.
surely there’s something from orenda you can refer to? launch parties, editing idk.
or refer to baker’s delight.
ahah.
pretend you couldn’t change it?
or use an example from school or uni.
obi not everyone has worked in an office environment.
it’s just, softening the truth… you did technically have a deadline - the party was booked in advance no?
you had to take into account printing time.
some of your writers were being lazy.
not responding.
perhaps - but they’re not going to get you to hire food trucks in this job so you don’t have to worry.
or if you do now you can prove that you know the requirements.
works both ways.
just spin your failures into ‘learning experiences.
‘.
its fine.
if anything they’ll use these as prompt questions in the interview.
so you can explain yourself better then.
Hmm no I think that sounds good.
You could say, it was all successful despite some last minute problems with the venue that I was able to overcome.
Ahaha.
Majic.
Nah, def magic.
Sorry was having a shower and left phone to charge 😓.
No turns out we aren't doing anything tomorrow.
So I can come over if you like!
Disliked “Provide an example of a time when you have worked as a part of a team in a workplace
My previous role of Salesperson at Baker's Delight required me to work as a part of a team in a workplace, especially during close shifts. Each of us had designated tasks to complete within a certain timeframe, to ensure the store was secure, clean, organised, hygienic and that the financial records were maintained. We would rotate roles or choose roles based on expertise or personal preference. One such role included disposing of the unused product, securing the front doors, cleaning the front cabinets, cleaning the bread slicer, ensuring general tidiness, sweeping and mopping. If one team member finished our tasks early or was struggling to complete them, the other team members would assist to ensure that the job was done to a high standard and on time.
It was important that we completed these tasks to a high standard. If we didn't, we would be letting down other team members when they arrived early the next morning and would make the next day's work inefficient, delayed, unsafe or impossible to do. If we didn't complete them efficiently, we wouldn't be paid overtime.”.

Disliked ““Provide an example of a time when you have worked as a part of a team in a workplace
Each issue of Orenda Magazine requires working in a remote team. Between Issues 1 and 6, the team has grown from 9 to 45 people, with a mix of previous and new Contributors each time. For our current issue, six, I have systematised the way we work to ensure maximum efficiency. This requires working with teams of writers, designers, artists and general team members, and ensuring each part integrates well and that everyone is on the same page. Each core team member has specific specialities which are maximised, and I can rely on them to complete tasks efficiently and to a high standard. “ I don’t think this is right tbh”.
Yeah go with the bottom one.
Tonight's white night too innit?
Maybe, it's always so busy.
I think there's something up at the Carlton gardens Nat your place, maybe we can just go there if we want.
Midnight picnic.

Goodnight! Thank you for inviting me over today ❤️.
(still waiting for the shower, had to wait for dad and brother to go first 😒)
I usually go in at that time ahaha.
No, too late...
Did you need me to go past Officeworks today?
Saw a poster for this on the way to work - free dim sum and doggos!
yeah!
My boss is wearing yeezy's.
Sort of impressed that as a 40+ quirky cultural sector worker she pulls them off.
Oh yeah all the kids these days are saying "I'll get Stacie to action that" and "it's time for our 10:00 weekly huddle".
Maybe, ill be working on the event that day so I might be pretty wiped out.
Gold, what size?
If you buy it online, I can pick it up from the QV store.
When you add it to your cart chose click and collect, I can get it this afternoon.
Otherwise if you tell me exactly the one she wants I’ll just buy it on my card.
It’s cheaper at office works anyway.
434.
ok cool.
ah sorry, I’m a bit too busy today.
Haha it's ok.
Orientation is this week so everything for that is done P much.
Found out they're going to keep me on after next week! Working on my two days off.
Working class boi.
In a cushy plus minimum wage office job.
AHAH.
yeah really happy about that.
Also they're looking for an intern to do social media stuff I got Sophia to apply so she might be working here too.
Loved an image.
Got it, coming home now.
Ahaha 😅 yes that is very true 💕.
😘always slipping off.
UMM xcuse me huny *I* get all *my* news from Married at First Sight!
Are you able to come into the city tomorrow evening? Working on the event on Wednesday so I prob won't see you until Thurs otherwise.
Yep!
😙💖.
Wasn't I going to do it at home? I won't have time at work.
When you get a tiny oil stain from your cream pasta on your light pink shirt, right in the middle 😓😖.
That's ok!
Ok!
Having dinner in city tonight.
Hey sorry I know it's a bit last minute but would tomorrow afternoon/evening be ok?
Yeah.
Got a bit mixed up Monday thought tomorrow was the event.
Ok cool.
Otherwise I could do Friday.
Ok!
👌.
Hey at your interview make sure you talk up your webmaster/WordPress/Squarespace skills.
Just saying 👀.
Just something I overheard I think they're looking for someone to update the creative sites? They're debating whether or not they should put out another job posting.
Interviews are next week she said.
Orientation for what?
Sice when do we have orientation?
0h hmm.
Just saw it.
We didn't have it last year did we? Maybe I didn't go.
Yeah I have a 1:30 class too.
There's an expertise class at 1:30 so hopefully it won't run too long over.
Betting it's just David being all like, you gotta work hard lol.
Or probs just explaining capstone.
Ty!
feeling better, thank you! ❤️.
how are you?
Most people are in bundoora today, at *that* event ahah.
Brunswick was yesterday, so it’s been rather quiet here this week.
Yeah I know 😵.
Loved an image.
Just ran into kat.
Was walking outside and she was coming back from work.
She's good!
Hates working for her family ahah.
But she's been promoted to the cash register now.
￼Went to the library on Monday.
👀.
Also overheard in the office that the intern may need to do some web editing/ WordPress /Squarespace.
So I told Sophia to talk that up in the interview.
👀👀.
Me too! A bit nervous bc I think they'd get quite a lot of responses.
But she also mentioned to that lady she knew on my team that she'd applied.
Also I think I got Elly a little job too lol? Ahah.
The dance lady runs her own studio and she needed some animated titles. Asked in the group chat and Tristan suggested her!
I'm the jobs fairy 😇.
😚💫.
Thank you! I'll try!
Sorry I don't think I'm going to come out tonight, up since 5:30 just want to have a quiet one.
The watered down cider isn't calling for me tonight ahah.
No worries, thank you! Getting it now.
Nup.
Good thank you! Just got on the tram back home.
No it finished at 2.
Haha tyty 💖 can I see you tomorrow night?
After work.
😚.
Was in the campus store helping run the scavrnyhubt from 12:40 onwards so missed the hottest part of the day phew 😌.
Ahah yes they did.
No bombs today.
Just got home now lol.
Ok thank u.
Looking forward to them in fact!!
Oh no!! 😖.
Yeah me too lol.
Saw about 70 of them.
AHHAHA.
Yeah we printed the blue on the back.
So it's double sided now.
Agreed 😅.
dunno. I do know we’ve had orientation the past three days so everyone was under the pump this week.
lynda’s been working till 7//8.00 most days this week so yeah highly doubt she’s had a spare moment to look through the applications.
No it’s us.
Careers is just a web portal.
don’t think they do HR.
managers have to sort out their own staff.
nah all g.
had a message from elly asking about that animation thing and i was like, ahah calm down nobody has had a spare moment this week.
it will probably happen next week tbh.
but i can ask when lynda comes in.
hey is it alright if we reschedule for 4?
sorry I’ve just got to finalise a few things today bc i won’t be back in the office for a while.
i have my studio then so it’ll have to be after 3.30.
but yeah otherwise thats fine.
👍.
no clue.
but looks likesomebody just won 50,000 velocity points.
I love how Andy always ends his emails with "look forward to seeing everyone, with snacks".
I wonder if it's a hint 🤔.
Ahah yes that's right 💖.
Also I forgot yesterday but ill.be doing that video thing with Sophia.
At 4, not sure how long it will be but I'll try and leave by 5:30.
How long will the video take do you think?
Ok cool.
Yeah Sophia said it should only take 30 mins so I'll see you after!
🌟.
Yeeeeee boiiii.
yay! good luck!
Coming now!
Yep coming down now!
Where are U?
Ok!
Meeting notes:
- illustrations w/ transparent background (tiff or flattened PSD)
- sync book file at start and end of design process instead.
- major revisions (1.3 -> 2.0) ready for approval.
- Sophia to write media kit and Adrian to put it together this week.
Almost there.
All g I don't think he'll mind. He prob knew you'd get it over him.
No we'll be eating here.
Hey when is the national is it next week?
Didn't put it down in my calendar.
Ok cool.
How did you go on orientation find any food lol?
Hey I just realised that next Thursday Im going to a concert. And next Saturday we have a wedding 😓😵😖.
Following weekend I've got a relative's 2nd birthday, then my brother's birthday the weekend after that 💀.
So I'm not sure if I can find a good time to go away 😭.
Ahaha yeah well there would have been so many more people today so they prob had to ration it.
No there were about 15 of us working.
The rest had blue shirts on, but they ran out so that's why I was the only one in the fluro best ahah.
AHAH.
I like that image.
Also what's your timetable like?
1:30–6:30 Monday.
All day Tuesday.
3 hours Wednesday afternoon.
But then I'll be in the office 9–5 Thursday and Friday.
But taking a break from work this week.
Uni work? Ahh not sure.
Dunno how I'll manage this semester.
AHHAHA.
I Only have about 12-13 contact hours, I think they said something about doing the same amount at home or something...
Problem with having just afternoon classes is it's hard to really do anything in the mornings lol.
In slightly better news you can come over tomorrow anytime.
Are you upset? 😞😓.
yeah, at my nonna’s. mentioned it yesterday.
my bloody home printer is pissing me off lol.
prints the right colours on a test page, but on the actual doc it gives up.
Yeah it's all fine.
Even when I print the colour bars around the outside, those are right but the content is wrong still!
Darkest part of the image should be that dark blue swatch.
Anyway I need to finish this tonight I'm just going to settle with cyan lol.
Ok.
So weird...
Printed it as an image too.
I know I hate them so much.
But love printed stuff.
Ahaha the curse of the print designer.
I know I'm sorry... I bought the tickets in early December when.
And yeah I'm doubt I'll be able to stay at yours overnight that weekend.
😭😭😭.
I'm so upset too.
But we can figure a plan b tomorrow?? 💖.
Whenever you'd like!
Sure! Sounds good 😚.
We can drop you back home too.
Also stay for dinner tomorrow night.
We shall not let you leave otherwise hehe ☺️.
First off, yay congrats!!
Volunteer I guess but still it could be cool 💫.
And umm hmm.
Yeah exactly.
Are they making some sort of book/magazine?
Of their members/collaborators??
And you have to design 10 of the pages?
That's what it sounds like to me but yeah it's P bloody vague.
Ok ughhh hmm.
Are you making the magazine then??
Yeah so it sounds like they'll send you the files this Wednesday, then you have to finish it by the following yeah? It's so poorly worded lol jaha.
Message when you're in Brunswick and I'll come and meet you at the tram stop.
Oh ok.
💫.
That's ok - was waiting to have lunch w I but I'll have a little snack while I wait.

Don't think they'll mind tbh.
Fair fair.
Hey sooo... Would it be ok if maybe I gave my national tickets to yoon?
Ahaha I'd like to go, it's just that I've got those two days off work and Ella was thinking of going away woops.
I forgot abt the show until I saw an ad for it and the next couple weekends I've got some family things on during the weekend 😞.
Ahahahhhh.
Hmm damn I don't want to ditch you alone look it's fine don't worry about it actually.
We'd both feel bad AHAHA.
I'll figure something out for me and Ella eventually lol.

Dunno how long they'll.be.
Otherwise I might ditch and meet you.
Ok I'm coming to meet you.
Indra wants a balloon.
We got one!!
Meet downstairs.
At the entrance.
❤️😙.
Yeah almost homr.
Got treated to some late 90s/2000s net art in the lecture today:
Morning ☺️.
Oh what?! Silly teacher.
Ok ill see you at lunchtime then.
Andy: "don't use muse".
Put your hand up if you tried muse and it turned you off.
Andy is letting the class run over not sure when we'll break.
Actually he just realised.
Ok !
Andy: "this was Indra's work. It was really smart, really!" ❤️.
Haha he's made reference to you a few times it's very sweet.
Sjw Indra fighting the good fight.
Fuk.
Pete evens 2.0.
Fuuuuk.
Jezus.
Fake bougie white hipster (me) woke.
Exciting! Haven't done anything yet but enjoying listening to Andy talk and ramble of course it's very inspiring.
Lol that wasn't the one abt public relations was it? British speaker dude?
Haha I think I started watching it once bc I had seen another of his doco's.
Its like borderline conspiracy bit for cosmopolitan liberals.
Yeah that's the one I saw.
I watched it after trump won it was like d U d E.
Yeh system.
Way.
Wat.
Wut.
Wot.
Keep cups?
Fuck me.
😭.
Expect to see you out with the socialists by next week.
Trully times have changed, advertising is WOKE NOW BABY.
Yeah looking at a few now.
Which manual?
Hmm I don't think it's here.
There's one called dad?
AHHAHA.
You guys done?
Ahaha ok.
Hey have you finished?
Cu.
👉👉.
?
Oh I'm nearby need to buy a shirt for a wedding this week.
Meet u near the food court?
Ella left at lunch her teacher forgot to show up.
Ahaha yeah big day.
Ill wait by Jimmy grants/ kikki k.
Loved an image.
No just got home sorry.
ah lol.
oh well.
Loved an image.
Awww 😌.
❤️💫⚡️♨️🤙💕.
So sweet so pure.
I think that's fine, no one in the office except the project manager wears a suit.
And even then it's not regularly.
Just think what would beck wear.
I think I wore chinos to the interview, but like it wasn't 28/30 deg back then sooo.
Yeah probs. But I mean is she usually has a nice top and either slim jeans or trousers.
Yeah I think the oldies have a certain expectation of formality, that's not really the case anymore unless you're in finance or something??!
I doubt Lynda would really care, last intern dressed sorta normcore like men's t tucked into black jeans soooo.
Wear what you would wear to a meeting with someone from activator.
Different parts of the uni would have different vibes I guess.
So jeans/top combo would fit in fine here.
I just think a suit looks too intense lol.
Like woah, serious vibes here.
Ahaha.
Nice.
Trust your gut.
Personally I think if they're trying to get a sense of what you're like to work with/personality, smart casual is a better indication.
Ahah it will go fine just try and not think too much abt it.
What time is it?
Pm? Oh wow that's so late!
Lol k.
Well I'll be around in the morning (need to get a haircut ahah) so if you wanna chill lmk.
Or have someone help u breathe.
Do you have some examples of work you can show in the interview?
I know it's not a graphic design job but maybe like social media stuff?
Orenda definitely.
AHHAHA great minds.
Yeah I guess, looks a bit more profesh if you have it all ready tho.
And can project it onto the screen in the meeting rooms.
Screenshot -> pdf on your laptop maybe?
Ahaha sorry.
Was just thinking abt mine and they liked being able to look at my portfolio on the tv.
Perhaps.
Yeah I guessed.
Guess.
Yeah just to help visualise what you've done.
I usually find having a visual prompt is helpful when I'm talking.
But otherwise screenshots on your phone would be fine.
Even just doing the quickview thing.
Nah missed my tram so still on my way lol.
Yeah agree that's easier ahah.
Hopefully I'll be done by 11:30/11:40.
I'll let you know we can meet up when I'm done.
Sophia's interview is today at 12:15 wish her luck!
Aha just arrived now, got to wait a little while though.
Me?! Ahaha shit.
My ruse is up.
AHAH.
it should be fine, I've mentioned to Lynda I have a friend applying and beck knows I know you?
Omg ofc.
I'm not head on tho so maybe they won't notice? 😜.
Jokes they prob will.
Can't get rid of me.
💫⚡️💕.
Nah it should be fiiiine.
Having it now.
Yeah.
It will go fine! Dw.
Done! Where's your meeting?
Not sure where room 3 is but 4 is where connect is.
You sure it's not 35/36 or something?
Wait I'll look around.
Hmm can't seem to find a 3 on level 4...
￼These are the project rooms they usually use.
Found it.
I'll wait by the giant pixel.
Wtf do you keep in here it weighs a ton.
It's ok beck has seen it just show them the pdf.
Hey what time are you getting here today?
Oh, no I've got 1 to 4.
It's all g.
Got here early for a haircut, now just minding Sophia's stuff during her interview.
Ahaha it's not that exciting.
Shorter than kat would want but like.
I think she wants me to have a flowing mane.
Or whatever.
After this wedding perhaps.
😙💕😜.
Haha.
Eating a fallafel salad from last night - jealous? ✨.
Oh dear 😞😵😖.
Silly bus.
😃.
In building 9 level 2.
xx.
Hey we just finished, where is your class at?
Oh good.
Indra wants a coffee from standing room in mc.
We are standing by the state library.
Ok ill wait for you.
Want to take a look?
Went past cos, there are two there that I liked: $99. Went past Marc's too but wasn't that much cheaper and didn't fit as well.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Just plain white.
Formal looking.
Do you have the jacket out, are you able to send a picture to remind me?
Not a big deal otherwise.
Thanks.
Ok heading back now.
Had a snack after class at 4 and shared some chips with Ella at 6, so not very hungry though.
Yeah will.
Maybe. Going away with Ella tomorrow, back sometime Friday. So not sure if I'll go to the launch or not.
But I'd like to!
Won't be able to stay late bc I have a wedding on Saturday lol.

Laughed at “He gets back at 9am so I told him he needs to go home and sleep”.
Damn boiii.

Ikr.
Coping.
Perplexed.

Cheeky Morris😆.
Wedding is over! So hot outside was melting in my jacket 😓.
Reception later tonight so a got few hours to cool down hehe.
Bleh.
Yeah true.
Guess that's why they were trying to get rid of it??
Hmm.
Bride and groom dancing to Ed Sheeran 🤢😝.
Hehe.
Hmm... I like your handwriting tho 😊.
Although I get if you wouldn't want to - I'd feel the same ahah.
Maybe tell them you're not 100% happy with it and would prefer a typeface.
Yeah maybe you're right.
Did you find and inline font? Personally I liked the Mrs eaves you picked first instead.
1at rule of working with bad client ideas... Make their idea look worse than the one you actually want haha.
Hmm do they not like the normal Mrs eaves?
I think it looks very nice with the plants 💕.
Ah ok.
Hmm well they can't be too picky 🤔.
You could turn the rest of your plant drawings into repeat patterns or something!
For their website?
Oohh! Exciting!!
Do show ✨.
Mmm.
Still looks delicious.
Yeah still going.
Just playing all the 80s tunes.
But not the good ones lol.
😝.
I got dragged up for one song but not my kind of jams haha.
dunno if you’re still looking for printers but i came across this one while searching for something completely different.
yeah it was nice.
so damn hot during the day tho.
the reception was at this fancy function venue outside the Collingwood training grounds or something. Both sides are mad collingwood fans evidently ahaha.
nah staying at home for once lol.
already behind with uni haven’t had a chance to work on anything.

sorry 😕.
after class? should be fine.

hmm no one is going to read that far into the play i think you’ll be fauna.
fiiine.
is that….
a salami??
Hey so is class at 1 or 1.30 now?
Ah ok. Yeah that girl was complaining so I wasn't sure lol.
Poor Karen now can't pick up her kids in time.
Um I posted that first bag thing we did. Someone else in our group documented the group one so I don't have a recording of it ahah.
Think it's to be done before class. Which is why I'm doing it now 💀.
Back on my old shit.
I think I'm going to use my brother's bookshelf, nothing of mine has any order to it fuck.
Yeah was going to tidy up my desk but cbf.
I'll see how I go.
4:30? Could finish earlier tho.
I'll let you know 😊💫.
Ahaha oh no still nothing?
Yeah all g I got ur back 😿.
Will the group's be like 4?

Yeah I know, but Tristan will be here instead.
My nephew?
Haven't seen him in so long.
Estranged from the family.
So selfish.
Ah ok, well if we do I'll come and find you like last time 💖.
Hmmm 😖.
Yeah I guess...
But rude of them not to send out a "thanks but no thanks" e-mail.
Well we'll know for sure by Thursday when i rock up and see either u or somebody else in the interns desk 😝.
Tru.
Slip em a mickey?
So many moustaches in this course my god.

Sorry didn't end up going.
Yeo.
Just walking with Ella to her stop, then I'll head home.
Can your new diet spare me some ramen later this week or next? 🍜.
Walked past a store and had a pang of longing 💫✨💕👌😚.
Ie. All of Stephen's lectures.
Also sorry about before,  Ella wasn't feeling ok after class - stayed and made her feel better.
👌.
Have you gotten the tat already?? Kat was disappointed in your timing 😠.
I'd come past now but I have to get back home, we have a family friend over 😓.
Also good luck for the date tonight!!
What?!?!
Are you and everyone ok?
Jesus.
Lol.
Oh my gos.
On the freeway??
Yes perhaps.
Ahh maybe for the best? Your seemed a bit stressed tonight?
That's so shit.
No chance of rescheduling?
Loved an image.
I need to find more cute animals to respond with 😔.
Did you get home alright? No more wayward mattresses?
That's ok, it's the least I can do when I'm the one that makes you feel like that in the first place 😖☹️.
I'm sorry if I ever make you feel like I don't love you as much as I do...
Bc I do!!
So much! 💕😁😚.
No one else is just like you, no one else can replace you!
I just want to make you happy.
Happy and warm ❤️♨️.
Omg lol going thru Tumblrs for Andy's and he continued to 100 Q's book LOL I thought he would have given up after that cluster fuck.
Let's hope last year's 1st years were more organised than we were HAHa.
Hey sooo I just read an email from Andy reminding us that tomorrow we're spending the morning at the Docklands library.
We may be back for lunch or we may stay the whole day - he hasn't decided 😔.
So hopefully I'll see you at lunchtime if we come back otherwise I'll have to see you after class? 😓✨💋.
☹️.
Yes certainly will!!
If we have a long enough break I may even be able to come back ❤️.
Sweet dreams 😚💖🌝.
Hey sorry, had to leave before the washing machine finished.
Yeah no sorry, we're staying here until 2.
So I'll see you after!
😔❤️.
Andy got featured in dazed once, highlight of his career.
Ok!
Oh thank God 😁.
Ahaha sonfickong stressful jesus.
same  tho.
ahah yeah that phrasing is a bit odd - makes it sound like they’ve got someone else.
but it could just be protocol that they have to be vague.
Finished now, coming up via tram. When does your class end?
Ok! Ill putter around until then.
I think on the brief it said something about covers?
Let me check hold on.
Nothing yet. Watched a Shakespeare movie as research ahah.
Yeah so it says to brainstorm concepts, imagery, type etc. It also says that in tomorrow's class we'll be doing pin ups of our ideas.
I have a note I made that says 'covers ready' so I'm going to work on those tonight.
Which play are you doing?
Think I might do Richard 3, haven't read it or any of the others either.
It seemed the less common one, could be interesting.
Yeah not sure what I'm going to do - have a few thoughts but nothing I'm excited about.
It's funny, my school picked the most obscure ones to study HAHA.
Merchant of Venice? Like who even knows that one.
Same!
Ditto.
Also I don't really have a ~concept~ either grrr feel like I'm just stabbing in the dark.
Ok! I'm just in building 8.
I can meet you elsewhere?
I'll wait for you in the b 9 foyer.
It's something!!
Haven't left the city yet so you're well ahead of me still!
Hahaha priorities.
Nah I'm good thanks, I'm so tired from wandering around and I need to eat fuck.
Ahaha.
Yes exactly.
Had my studio, we had class down at the Docklands library bc we're doing some work with them.
It's pretty cool! Got a big maker space with 3d printers, music rooms, electronics, vr.
All for free.
Who was your day? Get much done?
Yeah probs.
It should be fine.
We'll probably spend most time learning how to make books.
It's not too bad.
She showed us when I had her last year.
Although saying this I did stuff mine up at the time HAHAHA.
Friday!
😝.
Sorry I fell asleep.
Are you ok? Manage to get any rest?
Was going to do some more work on the covers this morning maybe we can meet too?
Ahh ok 😔 best to get your rest ❤️.
See you😚.
Miss you 💕✨.
Damn 😔.
I'm sorry 😕.
😍.
So adorable!!! ✨💕.
U feeling better?
Awww.
Sending digital hugs.
👐.
Hey we're down Elizabeth St so let us know when you finish class.
We had a 2 and a half hour book binding lesson today 😩.
Very helpful tho.
Just buying some materials now.
Haha no Shayna is quite entertaining.
Yep went past there! Got some book board.
Lincraft has good thread so we just left there.
Yep!
Need to get some paper soon, kW Doggett is now in Dandenong!! ☹️.
So weary 😝.
☹️😚.
There's another place in Southbank that's got good paper.
Not for printing unfortunately...
Yeah all like water colour or lino.
Also we need to get A LOT of sheets ahaha.
To mock up an entire blank book.
Yeah I saw a pick - nicer cover but same font lol.
Also he did another food event HAHAH.
Lol dieter would turn in his grave.
I think they toned it down a bit last year tho - no meal they just had a good related exhibition?
So like what 90% of the group's did last time I guess. Bc only a few had anything to do with the salad.
Also where are you at currently? Finished class?
We are done shopping, we'll head up to Shanghai village and meet you there?
Sweet, still on the tram.
Corey is stuck at work but is James joining?!
👌.
We are upstairs.
Yeah!
12.5.
For waffles.
Hey I'm good for you to call/message me now.
Adrianfranzese@gmail.com.
Everybody loves you, it's ok.
I'd prefer to talk when I'm not at home - I can wait for you to finish dinner.
One moment I'm in the toilet hehe.
I'll find a quiet spot then call.
Just remembered I left my book board at yours can I grab it tomorrow?
Or Friday?
Yeah no worries.
I'm getting dinner W Ella after work so I may get it after that if that ok...
Save me lugging a giant board to our date haha.
Haha sweet.
Nice 👌.
I told Ella about how you didn't get the job, she's really sad for you ☹️
"I don't understand why the universe isn't showering get with goodness".
😁☺️.
Are you feeling ok about it, we didn't really discuss it today.
Yeah, no we were excited too. Still don't get why they didn't pick you. But it's ok.
Was thinking maybe this could be a good(ish) thing. Wasn't very flexible and you kind of need that to be able to work on both Orenda and uni work!
So perhaps something else will come up that's more suited to your needs. Also possible that you may get passed along as a candidate if a similar position elsewhere pops up?
Like don't bet on it but that's how I my current job and a similar thing happened to Ella's sister at ANU.
Yeah the pay was hard to beat.
I know.
It's this in between that's hardest.
Don't fret ahaha!
It'll pass.
It's been a tough stressful week for you unfortunately ❤️.
🎥 Eric Andre- C'est La Vie - YouTube.
Sorry that phrase makes me think of this lol.
Sure ok, what time is it?
Ok.
I have my own lunch so I'll have that beforehand.
But let me know when you want to gp.
Yep!
That's ok.
I don't mind ahaha.
It's ok!
They're not in today.
Ye probably havent started yet.
hey would you be interested in working at Little Print?
Ran into one of the guys they asked if i knew anyone interested.
its working in the store, they need someone to help print, design etc.
yeah next store.
yeah, thought i’d check with you first. I’m going to tell Tristan too if that’s ok hahah.
he said just go past and drop your cv off in the next few days.
yeah that’s what i was thinking. since he worked in the dinkum store i thought they would prob prefer him, that’s why i am checking with you first.
who knows, they may want a social media person once they see what you do.
i know hahah.
yeah maybe, although i think he is also looking for something that actually pays.
Hey I ran into one of the guys from Little Print (next to Melb Artist Supplies)
And they are looking for someone to help in the store.
Working two days I think? They didn't say which but they will probably be flexible.
You'd be helping to print, design, etc.
Since you used to work at Dinkums U thought you'd be a shoe in.
* I thought.
Also I hwsr you need an internship too? Maybe tell them and they may be able to set it up as an "internship".
But I thought you'd also be interested in something that ACTUALLY PAYS.
👌.
All g.
Are you doing the internship next semester, is that why you were looking before?
Ah yes, ofc ofc.
Yeah that would be great. If I see anything I'll send it over. Best to look for it this semester, no one was hiring over the mid year break 😕.
Nah, not as an elective.
If I find something tempting I may apply, but dunno how I'll manage. Unless it's during the holidays.
Yeah I've noticed HAHA.
yeah, I'm doing Artist books as my sem 2 elective and don't want to drop that.
There's no real plus to doing the intern subject, aside from having a lighter class load.
Imo.
Yep HAHA.
fills up an elective slot I guess.
Tell me abt it.
✨💕💫.
🤷‍♂️.
That's ok I don't mind! ❤️.
Just need to take a poster out of its frame haha.
Won't be long.
💕 adios ☺️.
👋🤙.
We've got king krule tomorrow night remember, sans Indra ☹️😢.
Boost is getting into Bitcoin now 🤦‍♂️.
Hey are you at home within the next hour or so? Forgot to grab the board.
All good! Forgot you had class today.
I can come around whenever, let me know I and Ill scoot past.
Yeah no prob! Don't rush I'm here till 5.
Soz keep forgetting to respond.
It's at 8 yeah?
Ok it is.
Meet at the croxton at 7:30??
That should be enough time.
Or we can meet after 8 of you want, there's a support.
Are they the coaches?
Hmm interesting.
Not too bad.
A little busy atm can install later?

Lol was supposed to send that to Ella.
Fuck.
Not that incriminating.

That's my excuse.
Hey.
Disappointed that you accepted it so readily.
Easy easy baby blue.
〰️🎷〰️.
Sent this to kat by mistake.
Had my glasses off.
💀.
Prob true.
I forgot to put the caterpillar in it.

Woah early.

I tried making a test book last night, made the spine too big tho so it won't close lol.
So spoiled.
Nah it's all g, needed to practice so idm doing it again.

Was talking to kat abt it, that one with all the speaking symbols was haunting us.

Very cool.

👌good to hear. Don't stress I'll just hang around rmit for a bit and do some work.
Yep all good.
It doesn't have a dress code does it?
I'm just going to wait at uni and do some work.
What have you got for class tomorrow?
Fyi paper point isn't too far from the city, has pretty good options and does a student discount!
Hey Dad, I'm just waiting around at rmit. What time will you head over to Maha?
Would it be alright if I leave my bags in your car? I bought some paper today also so want to keep it safe.
Ah no it's ok I'll drop it off in mum's car otherwise.

I know you do.
I meant what are you bringing in? 😅.
What happened??
So full and tired...
😑.
🅱️lease 💕.
Screen printing quote came back 💀😭.
There goes that idea.
just under $60 for one print, need 2 designs so that will be at least $120.
my cover.
but i can go to impact digital (the ones we were using for RMIT) and they should be able to print in both silver and bright red.
mostly just wanted to try it out for fun.
hopefully these guys won’t be very expensive, never done any speciality inks before.
if we’re willing to drop $200 on a screen printing kit - sure!
or sneak into the screen printing facilities at rmit.
from eckerslys i think.
hahah true!
I'll explain in class?
Not much happening tho we just in groups.
Hey is it ok if we meet at 12 instead today?
Woke up not feeling so well 😣.
I think so just woke up with a good.
Colf.
Cold.
Had a shower feel a bit better.
fitbaseline.
Np!! Good to know I'm not the only one doing it before class.
Yeah no worries.
It's just how I like to work, nothing special abt it.
i don’t know whats happening but ok.
Haha not surprised and was considering it myself lol.
Yeah I can hang around for a bit after.
👉👉.
Hahaha ok good to know.
Fuck I think I'm coming down with something feel so sick today 😓.
Worst timing.
Still going to class tho I ain't that bad.
Human shield.
Except spice.
Ok!
Still in Carlton so maybe 10 mins??
Usually catch the tram from swanston St so idm.

Hey are u around? Just left class.
?
Good luck, going to head home not feeling too well today 👍.
No left class now, am waiting for my tram.
Have you finished?
60 A3 + student discount was only like $36.
But if you're doing a5 exactly maybe just get A4 for the inside and a3 for the cover??
👉👉✨.
Yeah I don't know either, the test book I made is 28 pages and is about thw right thickness.
Haven't squashed it yet so may shrink.
Definitely won't need 100. Unless you stuff up 😭.
The thread is only abt $3 I think.
Still waiting ... 😄.
I tried looking into screen printing they quoted be $60 a print and 6 week's turnaround 💀💀💀💀.
Take out a mortgage for this class fml.
Oh really? At dinkums??
Not that they're any good but.
Heading home now sorry, see u tomorrow night!!
Actually it's very full.

Thanks!
Ahah nah I don't think I can. I'm just on my way to work now bc I needed to sleep in a bit.
Had tacos last night tho!
Sorry.
Yep ok!
Pick a place to eat 💕.
Ah forgot abt that...
I think I was going to go over to Ella's? Not sure yet.
Hmm hakata will def be busy.
I'm happy to try the gyoza place, it's not expensive is it?
Ok that's fine 👌✨.
Easy easy baby blue 💕.
Loved “A burger but it has a very large hash brown instead of meat.. 🙈”.
Yummm.
Ok just waiting for a file to export!
Going to an RMIT exhibition tonight bao just getting dinner with Ella.
See you later.
Reckon you'd like this guy, 👉👉.
Haha it's good innit.
Just came back from the experimental jetset exhibition, check that out to when you get the chance.
He does done stuff for RMIT, but more for architecture Interestingly.
Ahah all g. Yeah at the design hub. Wanted to go to the talk but I was working 😑 probably wont have been interesting.
Yeah I liked it! Very cool exhibition design 👌ideas were a bit heavy, so don't have a hot take yet lol.
Hahaha fuck it was like 40 bucks!!
Longer actually, finishes early may.
Yeah yeag.
Very good.
Are you going to the book fair at some point? I was thinking of going Sunday with ella.
Ohhh yeah did our guys make a book for it?
Did you guys.
Pm? I'll see if I can swing buy, I'll probably have to pay tho.
Oh jeez.
Would get but 3 bucks 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃.
Not Fuego at all.
🙏🙏🙏.
Yeah maybe, not even I can handle all those peaches 😄.
hell yesss.
tacos for 1?
hahah meal planning us usually healthy but ok.
oh shit are they doing them both now? fuck yeah.
oh yeah, breakfast even.
I’m proud of u.
also my mum just realised whoopie goldberg isn’t gay?
I’m pretty sure?
not that my mother would be up with all that.
She prob assumed bc she wears pants and has a low voice 😛.
jk mum.
ur alright.
i know there’s the one where she’s a nun. basically it’s like school of rock but in a nunnery? I think??
and another one where she has a dinosaur detective sidekick??
I’m not really sure whats going on w his shoes.
like i get that he has big toes, but how does he fit them into converse?
and why is she in all latex?
ok wait so she gets put into a nunnery as part of a witness protection program, bc her bf commits a murder.
and she teaches them to sing in the church choir.
but her talent for teaching music ultimately leads to her undoing, when her and the nuns get famous and her murdeous bf finds her.
she’s probably hung over at some point.
but alas, no jack black.
oh shit maggie smith is in the nun movie.
we all have our lows i guess.
it’s fucking terrifying and i want to have a movie marathon of all these films.
somewhere jim henson is crying.
mostly.
OK WAIT so theres a sequel to the nun one where she DOES go teach music in a school.
yes pls.
by the members of the school board, yes.
dunno.
this was before i think.
i feel like every hollywood comedy has the red text, white background, peering over sunglasses.
ah yes.
thats true.
Oh yeah I've heard about this.
Movie posters should be such a fun thing to make, but i feel like thats never the case.
I mean like they are all driven by marketing and which actor is paid the most.
So you end up just having a bunch of floating heads on top of some explosions.
Ok you got me there.
Ah ok. Last year when kat did it they made a riso printed book.
Ok! I'm going to Ella's tonight after work so I doubt I'll be coming past. Will definitely be going Sunday though!
See you then 👍.
If I leave around 5, takes about an hour to get to yours does it? So around 6?!
On the pines 🚌.
Ooh Yumm!!
I don't mind! May be a bit chilly for a picnic tho.
Oh haha oh poor Jo.
Ohhh why???
Hmmm.
Is it bc I'm coming over?
Is it short notice??
Oh.
Hahah.
Busy busy.
Well I don't mind a bit of mess.
I won't even notice.
✨💕😽.
Still on Hoddle st.
Should I catch the warrandyte bus when I get off at the pines? Is your mum not able to drive?
Ok!
Uh not sure.
I'm off if it now.
Did my location not send?
I shared it when I got on the bus.
All goos.
At the pines now.
Where should I wait?
Ok!
Left or right entrance?
Near the library?
Or the other side.
I think I'm in the wrong sude.
Ok.
Yeah all good, had dinner. Feeling better today just a bit blocked.
I should be back around 2 today.
Hey did I leave a green Stanley knife and metal ruler on your table after Wednesdays class?
😽✨.
How's your night?
Ooh lovely.
Yeah just waiting on desert.
Haha did you take it though?? All g if not I'll get another one tomorrow.
I was thinking around 12:30?
Haha no stress! Just wanted to know if I had left it at school or lost it at home. 😄.
I'm going to buy some more paper tomorrow beforehand too.
I was going to go earlier haha.
But 1 is fine.
Heyo planning on going to paper point tomorrow morning W Tristan and Sophia around 11, and then we should be back for the book fair at 12:30!
I won't take long bc I know exactly what I need so I'll leave early if they are taking too long 🙃.
Still here at the restaurant 😆.
I know!!
Very long dinner.
Even the waiters are leaving ajaha.
Most likely ❤️⚡️.
You going to bed now?
Of course 🙃.
😮so cute ✨.
What there's more!
Ok you're definitely not going to be going to bed soon.
😁.
😽.
🌚💕😴.
Love you too!!
Get well soon 💕😽😴.
Did you find him yet?
Good!
Spent a bit too much money AHAHA woops.
A Korean graphic design mag, two or three little zines, oh and one of Karen/Andy's books ❤️.
I didn't see any robots either!
Mauve they were on later but Karen showed me these little booklets drawn by the machines.
Yes I will!
Are you feeling a bit better?
Awwww 😕😔.
Did you manage to sleep a bit?
Awww, 😢.
Is it a lot ? Or.
👍 good idea.
Hmmm oh dear.
Muse.
Problem child of the Adobe suite.
Hehe yes.
Oh well I'm sure that one has its problems too.
Hey did you end up getting your die cut stuff?
Oh haha damn.
Well you got it now! What is it like a special Blade?
Ahah all g dw abt it.
I still need to finish my design fuck fuck going to print tomorrow morning 🙃✨💀😓.
Haha ok so from what I understand Maddie has gone and filled out the rest of the spreadsheet with info from the Triennial labels.
So we have names, dates, media etc.
Tristan said today he might mess around with the Instagram API and see what he can do.
I sent it in the chat.
Lemme find it.
Whole class!
But it doesn't seem like any other groups have contributed so idk what everyone else is doing??
I think the prez is week 5 yeah?
Not sure either HAHA.
Fuck I'm not really sure tbh.
I'll read her email again.
But we just were to collect data between these classes.
Nah all good look I haven't done contributed much either tbh this book has been freaking me out.
Oh shit.
That night was a shambles from what I heard.
They're supposed to have videos projected but the one guy in charge of digital screens at rmit was like Sorry not my job anymore, and the new guy is sick today so tuff tiddies.
Don't know anyone in the catwalk club but know Beck who helps organise the art clubs.
Anyway back tomorrow, we're going to use the data to make group data vizs, just like lo fi ones. But she hasn't explained that to us so it's definitely not tomorrow.
😱.
😏👉👉✨.
Laughed at “🔥😎🔥 [ me walking through flames ]”.
Still feeling crappy?
Rest up tonight 💕.
😘🤧.
Fuuuuckkk work you to the bone for nothing then don't even thank you for it that's just plain rudd.
Rude.
Loved an image.
No I think your email was fair, and at the very least she'll learn not to take advantage next time.
This sort of thing happens fairly often unfortunately, so it's good to call it out when it happens.
Ok.
How are you going with your book?
Tristan Sophia and I are (maybe) going to stay back tomorrow night to do some binding if ya wanna join.
oh haha lucky for you (prob the smart option tho)
yeah feel free to stay back.
no pressure!
ok!
gotta print 1.
I need to go early too.
maybe.
still haven’t heard from CCC.
but I know from Polly that they print Gold/silver.
just a matter of price 😟.
That one time I went in first year yeah they were not great.
Otherwise I think I'll just do gloss at Impact Digital.
Except it's in Brunswick.
No not very far, right next to the train station.
Yeah, didn’t realise but it sounds like a laserjet only thing.
Oh wow fuck that.
Can't believe this.
Like.
I think you made yourself pretty clear in your email.
Are you going to bother calling or just leave it??
Hmm I was planning to get to uni around 9:30, if you don't want to meet that early I can see you later?
Yeah fair enough.
It's hard to believe.
Ugh I just feel so shit for you and now she's trying to turn it onto you 😠.
11:30 will be ok!
I'll probably just be around, mildy panicking.
Haha never.
Yeah idk you got to be on your toes, can't trust nobody it sucks 😅.
Haha no I'm fine.
It will print out fine dw.
Also can you send Indra some cute dog/cat pics she's not feeling to good atm.
The fashion thing didn't go very well, they didn't print the catalogue.
So all that time and stress for nothing.
Yeah she sent an email to the organiser and she replied sort of being a bit bitchy? Like, "what did you expect to get paid for this?!".
Thank u 💕✨.
Yeah so she's just a bit disheartened abt the industry rn 😕.
Ah yes your famous rifle.
Hey idk if I can make coffee at 11:30, printer troubles.
Heading to impact now so I may not have a chance sorry.
Hopefully!
I should be back at 12:30.
😓.
On the tram back now!
Ahaha ok.
It's not that hard.
You'd still in the Mac lab?
B10.
Lol u vomigg 2day?
Coming.
Can't spell.
Obviously.

Sorry left phone to charge on other side of room.
Yeah I'm just doing the blank book.
Ok whatever you feel like is best 💕 see you lunch time.
Yeah I'm going to head off soon.
Yeah I'm fine, just being too careful so this is taking longer than I thought.
Nope Tristan and Sophia are here! Indra was too until a couple hours ago.
That is also why this took so long.
HAHAHA.
Oh true.
It's ok.
We drive eachother up the wall sometimes haha.
In a nice way.
Sorry was packing up!
Ohhh don't say that!
We'll see eachother all soon, it's just we've been all busy.

I know - I just dont want to let him down😔.
Ahaha I guess that's true.
Hey did you want to try and get that zapier thing working today? Just may take a couple days of running to get enough images.
You can insert a formatter step between insta and sheets to convert the time.
Or we do it after the fact doesn't matter.
Unless you have class today in which case don't worry!!
Gotta relax more and be a super chill 3rd year 😆.
"yeah like I don't know man you just gotta feel it out sometimes like you know?".

That's ok I don't mind! I just want you to feel better ❤️❤️❤️❤️.
Good luck!
Oh good! Very happy to hear that 😘.
Yeah haven't opened them yet but the sonnets were on top and it's basically just gold.
Knew it was a risk to try it bc was basically shooting in the dark, just a bit disappointed that I threw all that money away basically.
Internals I just reprinted at rmit on my paper - can't tell they weren't done professionally!! 😆.
Can't tell from within the bag.
Just got home.
But knowing that you feel better makes me feel better haha.
Yeah I should shouldn't I 😣💀.
Ahah it's the least I can do 😚.
Yeah I might actually.
Ahaha idm seeing it again 😍.
Red came out a lot nicer at impact than CCC (a bit of a purple shift.
And text pages came out looking very crisp, shame I can't use them anymore.
It isn't tho.
Oh in different light there is a faint sparkle.
But it is quite dull.
Was expecting that bc of the uncoated paper I guess.
What can you do... Know for next time I guess.
(Adrian don't do anything fancy)
😩just over this atm.
Want to just fast forward to it being handed in.
Can't wait.
hey my phone has gone flat and isn’t charging for some reason, am binding atm so if I don’t respond for a while that’s why 😓.

Perf arts dude is looking for someone to make some posters for a performance of war of the world's.
So I gave him Georgia Jaze..... something something 's email.
And also Suzie.
To see if they wanted to nominate some students.
Yes!
I thought maybe if he wanted something more illustrative she'd be a good reference.
Yeah I would have suggested Indra personally but they decided to go through the lecturers.
Only to reinvigorate her after the tragedy of the fashion thing.
Haha I know ❤️.
Better than the job shop!
Ok idm!
I'll just move away from the street.
Yep was just on the phone with Ella coming back now.

Don't recognise any of those names.
Also why are Russian hackers targetting my uni design blog???
😽(say hello to lupi for me)
You're welcome, anytime ❤️.
Hmm interesting.
Bit of a downgrade tho?
It runs pretty well, battery is still ok.
Ah ok. I've heard rumours that they may release another one, or something to replace it in the line up.
Oh that's right.
Yeah idk, up to you.
It's a couple years old already tho, and these phones tend to get quite slow after about 3.5 years.
Although like I said mine is working just fine.
Do you think we can meet before class tomorrow morning and finally go to Vacation? ✨.
Been waiting so long ☺️.

Hey we are downstairs in level 2 if you want to join.
Hey I'm so sorry.
I had my phone iny pocket I was trying to finish the presentation, that's why I wasnt checking my phone in sorry.
I didn't know you were texting me.
I'm sorry.
I know.
I was trying to finish this project I'm sorry.
I'm on bowne st.
😞 I know, I didn't see you come in.
Like right at the start, then I turned to look at you were chatting W indra.
Yes.
I'm outside b9.
I can be late to class I don't care.
Did you want to talk.
What time does your class gunshot.
Finish.
Ok I'll make sure to leave then.
😽😔.
Ok hopefully we will have presented by then 💙💕❤️😽.
We'll go ealry.
Oh dear, tristan has just been informed his grandpa passed away ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️😨.
So we'll present soon and leave.
Yeah not good, he seems ok tho.
He didnt want to rush off.
But you know what he's like.
All steely.
Yes I think he will.
I'm out where are U?
Hey hope ur ok man, if there's anything for other classes you miss I'll pass them on 👍.
Yeah by b9 entrance.
That's ok, I love you anyway hehe.
Yeah I know, I realised afterwards the mistake I had made and how that would have come across to you.
And then I went up to try and find you but it was too late.
So don't apologize.
Yeah I guess so I didn't think it through.
Yeah, but I also didn't want to ditch the group ☹️ so I thought this would be ok.
But it wasn't obv.
Yeah I know I should have just said so 😔.
Hey I just ran into a friend so I'll be back a bit later still.
Yeah no it's ok.
Oh no, well just so you know I won't think you're a burden when you tell me these rhings.
😽.
That's why I want you to open up to me!
Hmm U help by beongy gf!
Being my gf.
💕💕❤️💙.
Loved “Thank you, I used to be afraid to open up to anyone because I thought they would reject me but you have only responded with love and kindness to me and I thank you for that ❤️”.
😽😽😽😽.
Rather u cry onto my shoulder in private but what can you do ☺️✨😘.
No not yet, ran into yoon getting off the bus just grabbing a drink W him now.
Hehe ok ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.
😽.
Hey just finished with Yoon, on the tram rn. ❤️.
☺️😘😴.
Hey!!
What's up 😽.
Had a little pizza.
Glad.
Yeah probs.

That's the main qs.
Good good.
Should I leave you to continue working?
😙.
(or do you not mind me distracting U)
Ahaha ok.
Best not bring the phone in.
Same tho ❤️.
Ok well we can talk when you're out.
😘.
I feel sick just thinking about how I didn't respond to you 😔 I don't really have any excuse/rationalisation for what I did. Kat and Indra both were kind of like, "yeah, guys tend to miss that signal lol". But I feel like you deserve better. I'm always telling you, yeah I can fit you in it'll be fine but I always end up leaving you waiting or only half focused on you.
I want to do better.
So I'm sorry, and I'm going to try and be more realistic with my time from now on. Ie after work.
☺️💕.
To lighten the mood...
So cheeky.
Goodnight, don't stay up too late 😘.
Oh dear, and he I am still in bed haha 😴🛏.

Not the best start to work today:
InDesign on the iMac kept freezing, so biting the bullet and updating.
So forced to use my laptop again.
Lynda in a meeting so don't know what she wants me to do today.
And Tim (big boss who is now prioritising my tasks) is not in today, and hasn't told me what I should be working on.
Haha great start to this new system lol.
😑.
Thank u.
Well it's the whole Adobe suite, so may take all day...
But didn't have a choice.
Can't work when it beach balls whenever I scroll or save.
🙃🙃🙃🙃.
(why does my 7 year old laptop work better than a 4 yr old iMac?)
Also I haven't updated my Mac software in a long time, but HEY APPLE at least it works with Adobe!!!
Afraid to update in case things break and I'll be 💀💀💀💀💀.
(sorry for these software rants, hope ur day goes better than mine)

💕⭐️.
Coming home.
I'll try and get there around midday, although with public holding ptv it may be a struggle.

Old Greek bus driver just told a young Bobo couple to not leave their child in the pram.
"is that baby mine or yours? Take care of your child".
Dad: "ok we will thank you".
A gaggle of bros behind me just blasting teenage dream-era Katy Perry.
Off the bus now walking up.
Hey Daniel wants to go see Eraserhead on Monday night, did our want to come too??
It's on at the Astor in st Kilda.
Right outside the train station there.
Hmm no unfortunately, just them.
It's not that far out from the city, only about 10 mins by train.
We'd prob meet at Flinders and head down together.
Oh damn what a pain.
Oh dear, if you'd prefer not to you don't have to go ahaha.
Yeah I think Daniel is getting them.
Yep! Asked Adam if he wanted to come I think he's still thinking abt it.
He just asked now did you want to go or not? It's fine if youd rather not!
Hmm Flinders st station.
Then we can catch the train down its only 10-15 mins.
Hmm idm.
Hahah sorry.

What time do you get back to civilization tomorrow?
Oh ok, nice 🐋🌞.
(would u be able to sneak out and join me for a day out?)

Would that not leave us with much time?
Otherwise we could meet Tuesday during the day? A bit convoluted going back and forth tho...
I'm in bed rn so I'll ask tomorrow morning, but I'm not doing anything I don't think.
I should be able to come over and stay the night x🐣.
I thought U wanted me there all day Tuesday and most of Wednesday hehe 😗.
Just have to settle for a bit less I guess.
😣.
Seeing as I cancelled the last time my siblings went ahaha.
And it's been over a year.
Should have put in for the morning, I guess mum thought I wouldn't be awake then lol.

I didn't get to ask last night, but how is uni?
That's good to hear! Haha don't worry that never changes lol.
Ah damn, would have been nice to start out strong.
Like an in class demo?
That's good.
Yeah I've had one class that's quite intense, had to bind two books in 4 weeks lol ☠️.
But the other two work on longer timeframes so they aren't very stressful, but it's easier to fall behind.
Yes, unfortunately 😣.
Good morning! 🐶🌞.

4k 👌.
Me either 😚😊.
Yes just finished! On our way to the station 💕.

One of the two haha.
It's giving me a bunch of changeovers now, what's the station near county court? It's Flagstaff isn't it?
Looks a bit closer.

Just made it onto my tram ❤️.
It's ok don't apologise 😙.
🐹.
Still on the bus? 😕.
Yeah just finished eating ahah got so hungry on the tram.
🤤.
You home to now? 💕.
😊.
Yay! Dinner time?
Oh dear *stomach grumbles*.
Sorry was just going through FB app turning everything off haha took a bit of time.
Ads and stuff.
Apparently a bunch of sites have been uploading my contacts without my permission??? Or they've received them from a third party???
So fb has my contacts even though I've never let them upload to them??
Or these other places do at least.
It's a bit BS.
😠.
Haha nobody does anymore!
No this is standard practice unfortunately...
Read earlier that only 50 Aussies used that app that stole their data, but that meant up to 310,000 others had their data taken without consent.
Well "steal" is perhaps the wrong word, seeing as fb and Google basically lay it out on a silver platter for whomever 😣.
Loved an image.
Very gross.
⚰️🔄.
But this way I get advertising that's relevant to me so that's a fair trade!! 👍👌💯.
Instead of slightly less irrelevant ads which I don't care abt anyway!
Faustian pact more like 😈🤝👨(<- Zucc)
Yeah hold on let me head to the spare room for some privacy.
Yup!
😙.
