Sorry for being a fucking amazing drunk person.
Also I felt like may be I was cock blocking Dante. I do apologise.
Yeah sure it's been pretty good.
Yeah it's bloody confusing. I don't think we timetable for semester 2 though.
At work I over heard them say we don't.
The call centre is in my office.
Idk don't take my word.
Try and do both.
All g.
Safe travels! ✨❤️.
Kisses beautiful 😘.
Walking down the street now, good night!
Haha ofct.
Thanks for coming out.
￼Lol wat.
(I know why it happens it's just so funny to me)
Let's say around 7? I have to double check what time the dinner is tho.
Hmm maybe 7:30.
Dinner is at Docklands unfortunately, the tram nearby goes along Collins St...
Maybe just Melb Central.
I told Tristan that we'd get some snacks and drinks.
Or qv.
Yeah let's.
See you! I'll let you know later on if we need to meet later.
Haha I will try 😴.
God old straight men are so boring.
Haha ty we're playing lawn bowls now lol.
Sure ok thank you!!
Oh uh ok if you want! I'm not sure what time we'll finish dinner, we're still at bowls club.
I'll let you know when we go for dinner, if you want to leave for the city then?
Ah ok.
Yeah eat. Just got told about 10 mins here. Sooo should be done by 7.45?? I'll leave as soon as I can.
Haha sorry it's so vague.
If you want to go to Tristan's earlier you can, James will be there till 8, Kay is coming later too like me.
I'll let him know.
If you want.
Ok! Whatever you prefer.
Lifeless and SO thicc 👅👅👅.
Ok we just arrived at the restaurant, and actually it's in China town so it's a bit closer. How are you doing?
Classic.
😘.
Sorry bad reception in here.
Food still hasn't arrived unfortunately.
Maybe just some ciders , James will be staying now haha.
Hey I'm almost done here where are you now?
Ok I'm in Chinatown so I'll head up to find you. I'll get you know when I'm near.
Coming up Russell st now.
Meet you near your bus stop.
We are ok our way back now, taking an uber.
Ok thanks, that should be fine.
😘.
Good morning! Are you awake?
Lol such a busy kat.
Well Ella is free either night!
HAHA.
She's been robbed of her independence now poor girl.
You're welcome! Anytime ❤️.
How is lupi more importantly?
Ah very good 😻.
Ahh so brave 💕.
(sent with Gentle Effect)
Don't feel bad!
😨.
Warrandyte sure is dangerous.
Oh, the studio?!!
You can't seem to catch a break.
Yeah I'm looking at it now.
It's sounds like they got the memo about not enough folio work haha.
I've just read the first para let me see...
Hmm it actually looks really good.
Like if they took brief Sabbatical but added more "practicality".
I think you'd like it a lot actually.
Me too!!
Oh so they stuffed up the expertise class on myTimetable. It's listed as a Prac and a Studio, but it's all the same thing we just enroll in one.
So there's 8 classes.
But two have been listed incorrectly.
I have no clue why this problem hasn't been fixed yet, but they explained on our FB group.
Ah ok, I have to do one of the monday ones bc my elective is on Monday.
Shit yeah haha.
I'm doing a Wednesday class.
Yes of course!
Is your elective on Wednesday.
?
What time?
Ok well I'll just catch up with you after it hehe.
Also the 5.30 Monday lecturers are still on, they just hid it in the studio timetables.
My elective actually goes into it by an hour oh well.
Ikr.
Haha yes perhaps, destiny.
Yeah I'm thinking.
Don't mind missing a bit of them.
...Or if they are recorded again 🤔.
Hopefully!
Never ended up watching the one I missed so good track record Adrian 😜.
Hey what time do you think you'll be back?
Nvm trams are running again there was an accident earlier.
That's alright, quickly realised my mistake.
This new timetable is a clusterfuck, fb group is going off.
I did the same thing, can't get rid of it now 😣.
Suzie posted to say Neil and Toni are in today, maybe they'll finally fix it.
I'm just going to wait and see.
Hmm, interesting.
Can't remember if my intensive was in the timetable, I think we may have just gotten and email telling us.
Email the coordinator?
But some people's classes havent even been added into myTimetable yet.
Sophia is doing a VE class, and they still have the old system - but the lec was like "oh I'll add it Monday!".
So she has no idea if she can even do this course let alone when it is.
Renae is doing it too, but nobody knows if they'll get the right credits for it.
Everyone is still on holidays it seems.
Business skills go out creativey.
For.
Business skills for creatives.
Sorry was walking and one hand free.
HAHA.
that sounds fun.
hmm, they show you the percentage of which people picked which class, handy.
Also semester 2 is read only, so i guess that settles whether or not we have to do it.
no studio email yet?
me either dw.
it’ll prob come later today.
once our lecturers wake up from their lazy holiday slumbers.
Yeah just got in now.
😗u2!
rmit student life got a prelim version of their brand this morning...
.... and it’s a bit shit.
like a real phoned-in design.
haha rmit loves to have brands!
bc then it all looks the same as the academic and corporate voices i guess.
I mean it’s very confusing, but i understand why certain programs want to establish a different voice to the rest of rmit.
but yeah it’s probably too much in the long run.
Yeah maybe, where is David Jones again?
I’ll see how I go this afternoon.
I'll leave in abt 10 mins, I need some fresh air anyway.
Ok got it.
Yeah I was going to ask, have to see if she's free Saturday.
Also are we still doing your meal thing tomorrow?
What time did you want to do it?
Oh ok, I just assumed it was during the day but this is better.
See you around then.
I'll ask again but I think sp.
Daniel's dinner thing is tomorrow at 6/6:30, are you free to come?
His possibly poisonous dinner.
(not really he promised he won't)
Ok cool, thank you I need the support.
He said to get there around 6/6.30.
Yeah he'll come.
4 Mia Close.
Reservoir Vic.
Australia.
I mean, sometimes you just don't know!
I should have specified Planet Earth, he often doesn't give that impression but that's where he's from!
Do we need to get tickets in advance for this thing?
Ok sweet.
Morning to my favourite cat 😘.
And owner ofc ❤️.
Hey feel like grabbing another coffe later today? Doesn't have to be for long.
Haha I was thinking around 3?
Or is that a bit late?
Yeah no worries.
Just somewhere nearby, prob pool house again lol.
￼Scavenger maps arrived!
The inside is a bit bleahh bc of all the text and changes I needed, but I'm glad I was able to keep the cover the way it is haha.
Hehe thank u 💕.
Coming out now.
Outside like last time.
Won't be home for dinner I'll be home later tonight.
Ah ok.
Haha all g I feel ya.
It's ok dw.
Lol just saw another logo using myriad for the word University how many changes ffs.
Whent to Google Steven and typed Stephen Bannon lol.
Wrong nazi woops.
Omg theres a video interview on his site abt it he looks SO 2006.
And sweaty?
I couldn’t finish it lol.
yeah it seems like it?
So fuck that sign’s old.
heritage.
“COMPUTERISATION”.
ew i don’t want to give him the satisfaction.
oh god another one.
UM THATS THE POINT.
TEH SIMPLICETY.
No sorry, I’m not really sure who’d to contact abt that. The NAS team dissolved end of last year 😟.
I think property services now handles a lot of the NAS stuff now?
Nah she won’t, I can ask her she’s right here hahah.
yeah not surprised.
What did you want me to ask specifically?
Oh ok sure yeah i can do that.
yeah ok I’ll ask her when she doesn’t look as busy.
she knows you by name yeah?
cool.
“Oh yeah i remember sophia, she’s cool”.
She wasn’t 100% sure, she’s sent me a link for venue hires but I think it might be staff only, try it out anyway.
Otherwise you can try sending an enquiry to venues@rmit.edu.au but idk how quick or nice they’ll be.
She knew the lady who was in charge of RAD last year, but I don’t think she’s doing it anymore?
rachel.yeo@rmit.edu.au.
Maybe mention that you’re with Activator or something?
There’s the “Innovative Design Showcase” in NAS that could be useful, it’s that weird round room opposite campus store.
She wasn’t so sure about the megaflexes.
Otherwise she said email her.
Hey what time are you going to get to Daniels do you think, I'm catching the train bc Im at work currently but I should get there around 6:30.
Mega flexes are the ones near my office, Medibank is in one atm.
They didn't seem to be on that site though when I looked.
She also opened the booking system for the library and study rooms, they could be there?
It was called it bookit I think.
Haha lol I just left right after work. Should have eaten damn.
I'll get something afterwards if I need.
Don't expect anything less.
Ok I'm here finally.
I'm here now are you nearby.
No I'm inside.
Yeah I'm out the front.
Yes I would love to!
￼Mum made some sourdough bread!
She's been trying for a little while, finally got it!!
Yeah definitely! ❤️💕.
What time will you be around?
Let me know and I can leave early.
Yeah it'll be ok.
How are you going?
Did you want to go to very good falafel for dinner? It's open till 10.
No im still busy so take your time.
Ok leaving now where will you be?
Sire.
Sure.
What time tomorrow are we meeting?
8 is fine, I'll just eat at Home 👌.
Yes just told her.
Nah all g I'm spending all of rmit's money on food anyway lol.
Ah sorry forgot to message earlier but I'm getting something to eat with Ella tonight.
I have your tea jam!!
Did you say you'll be in the city during the day tomorrow?
Yes sweet.
Also gives me an excuse to get coffee with you haha.
Yeah I would have brought it Friday otherwise.
Or you could leave it, turn it into an installation.
Performance art.
Nah I'll leave it.
We can have some on Friday!
YUM!
Yaya! Where at?
Nice.
Omg lol.
Haha why can't good be both?
Oh dear I hate that.
Not that I believe in such nonsense ofc.
Hehe.
Is that?... Steve Carrel on the front?
Damn guess there are some things you just can't learn at school.
Hmm, fascinating nevertheless.
Well I'm just glad they didn't try to convert you.
The word of good old JC.
Oh yes Mary.
The other one, nit his mum.
Oh I thought it was a conspiracy, as in the davinci code?
The Catholic church didn't want people to know.
For some reason?
Doing God's work.
It was nice seeing Sandy and Raf today, dinner was very cute!
this is perfect.
I think I saw something like that.
Maybe it was a picture.
Ah yes maybe, I have seen that before.
Oh shit I left the tea.
😣.
Left it on the countertop to remember it.
Can I bring it on Friday?
What time are you coming in today? We can still catch up.
Ah ok, I'm not sure for how long I can skip out.
Sorry, yeah I might be able to get to the city at 7:30 - depends when we have dinner.
Yeah still here.
Nah got to go home for dinner then go the the Ngv with Indra and ella afterwards.

Very nice.
Ok, I thought you were going home tho? View.

Wrong person.

But now you know.

ABC blasting Barbie Girl.
Those Bros getting down to boogie.
Hmm well I got up a bit late unfortunately, still got to shower and pack so I think I can get there by 1 if I leave by 12.
Hey sorry just about to leave, parents didn't want me catching all those busses and trams in this heat so had to wait for them.
But I'll catch your bus from Hoddle at 12:57.
She probably won't believe me but you're free to tell her yourself.
Also I told her a bit about your jc trilogy.
On the bus now!! 😗.
Yes I think so, she seemed a bit grossed out by the end however.
Not by anything in particular just it's decline into Middle of The road running out of steam comedy.
I'll try haha.
Sorry I'm so late.
Haha.
Yes off.
❤️.
I'm here!
Shall I walk up?
All g.
Around 7.30?

Sorry felt a bit sick this afternoon, was having a nap. Feel better now so I should come around 8:30.
How is it going there?
What from the heat?
Ok well should I come or have people already fucked off.
Ok well we'll come but can't guarantee that I'll start for long I'm still kind of gone.

Nah it’s in hawthorne, bloody inner city mate.
One of Indra’s friends is doing the double-degree design/business there.
Haven’t spoken to him in a while so idk what he thinks tho ahah.
Yeah ok, nah it's fine just pay me back in total when you can. I'll transfer the money from my savings account.
So lazy.
Good, we'll miss you otherwise.
Fuck your degree satisfaction.

Waited around for the moon, disappointed that nothing was happening, then realised the eclipse will be in an hour or so haha.
Hopefully I'll get a look from home.

💻🐒.
Got something on but i should be home for dinner. I'll check and let you know.
What time?
I have to be in the city at 7.30, I don't think I can go.
You can if you all want I'll just have leftovers.
I'm at work today, finish around 5. We can get something to eat if you'd like?
Otherwise I might quickly est at home, but I don't know if I'll have to do that tbh.
That's fine I'll probably won't leave bang on 5 anyway.
Mc is closer.
Haven't left yet so if you go to mc I'll meet you at 5.30.
Or whenever it is you get there.
5.40 ish?
Coming down soon.
Ok! Was thinking either tomorrow or sat.
Tomorrow after work we're saying goodbye to the intern she's invited us to drinks in fitzroy.
So after that?
Is there a later showing?
Hmm ok ill figure it out tomorrow I'm with Adam atm sorry!
Also would you like to come over Saturday during the day? Tristan was thinking of inviting people over sat night so you could come back with me again.
Oh ok yeah whatever you prefer.
It is a pain to lug around.
Idm!
She won't mind! I'll tell her to cook something normal ahaha.
Mate I've been to yours like plenty more times.
But yeah think abt it.
HAHAH HA.
Ok so.
How long do you think your meeting will be ?
I was thinking we could get dinner maybe in fitzroy then go to the Nova to see the movie at 8:30?
I don't think I'll be able to make the 6.00 session.
Hmm no it's about 20-30 mins.
It's 8.35 according to their website.
I'll try not to stay too long with this thing before, depending when we get there I should be out by 6/6.30.
Or 6.30?
Ok!
Ooh now I'm nervous haven't checked.
Oh thank God I got Andy's.
Union club hotel.

Was thinking either pizza (laserpig) or Japanese (neko neko)
🙌.
Heading out now sorry.
I found heaven: a pizza place that plays dream pop/shoegaze and who's logo is a flying pig with Lazer eyes.
You're welcome! I'm sorry I'm always making you wait around for me ❤️.
Let me know what time you want to see me tomorrow.
Also what studio?
Hey did you get your first pref?
Yay glad you got it!! Should be ok even without him tho.
I got into Andy's, very excited ⚡️.
Ahah thaa saying something coming from you.
I love being confused, bask in the confusion.
Oh damn.
Pretty good resting state then.
Ella got her first pref too.
It used to be this illustration one, but they changed it to a do-whatever-you-like one.
Similar to what I did first sem last year, but more business focused! It sounds really good.
Yeah she's well known to people who aren't me apparently HAHa.
Yeah easy!
Did you get home alright? Are you feeling a little better?
😃 glad.
Sending you lots of kisses and hugs 😘.
Love you lots, Amore mio 💓.
Fuck it's only like 3 weeks away.
Where did my break go.
Oh I'm not sure if I can come see you anymore tomorrow 😞.
My nonna slipped today and broke her ankle we might be going to see her tomorrow after lunch 🙁.
I'll let you know tomorrow morning, she might not have been discharged by then.
She should be ok, could be much worse. Stuck on crutches for 6 weeks now.
I'll see what happens.
More like yuppie scum tbh.
📍 Lazerpig.
9-11 Peel St.
(03) 9417 1177.
Oh cool! Tania's classes always seem very interesting it should be good.
Yeah I made it into Andy's 👨🏻.
😕 it's ok, if Audrey is stressing you out just tell her you can't go.
Don't feel bad, it wasn't your fault.
I miss you too, but I get to see you allll next week remember.
I still love you just as much even when you're sad 💕 please don't feel guilty ❤️.
Haha tuff titties there my friend. Did you see Sophia's snap abt Swinburne.
(she's staying, her elective is fine)
Only course I'm not keen on is the core one - it's that 4 weeks of one thing bs.
Don't learn shit from it.
Oh haha fuck true they had it in open day fucking yr 11.
I mean I've always liked what the students do with it but seriously, so many classic Greek texts to pick from.
Lol.
🤷‍♂️.
David has taught you well it seems.
Embrace the unconventional.
Fair fair ill leave you to your walk 👋.
Nnnnnnice.
Would do they dame tho.
Same.
Did you manage to fall asleep?
Hmm.
Spoke to Indra and kat btw, they both got their first prefs.
(sell out and Perfection, respectively)
Very ❤️.
Hasn't been discharged yet, they want to make sure she can use the crutches properly.
How did you go with your lunch date? ❤️.
Feeling better)
?
Ah, yeah you would have needed it.
Yay, wasn't that bad!
Oh ok, Stephen and I just finished the pasta.
How did you want to split it? Yours was only like 6.95.
48.25 in total / 5 of us = 9.65 each. Is that alright?
Yep!
Thanks ☺️.
Oh dear, what a shame 😞.
He looks quite cute tho.
He's so dark!!
Very witchy.
And gangly.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
Haha did you get much more sleep last night?
Oh hmm I guess you're just shifting your sleep schedule around.
Do you get a lunch break? We can meet then.
Yes please! Let me know when it is, I usually break at 12/12:30.
Oh I don't think that's true, he's probably just a bit anxious after today.
He just needs his alone time 😺.
Laughed at “I had a dream last night that Guillermo del Toro asked my dad to build a giant set piece in the desert for his next film. And he wanted it done by December which in the dream was only a few months away.. ”.
So cute 💕.
Not your strangest though, but up there.
Hehe.
HAHa.
Perhaps, but surely he does everything in 3d now so it doesn't take as long.
Oh dear, did he run out of time?
Del Toro's loss.
This is very good 👌.
ooh cool listening now.
they just popped up on my youtube never heard of them before.
Sure do!
I thought it was like dream pop meets Talking Heads, very nice.
The French cheese toastie place has opened...
Yesss!!
Have you started class yet?
Ok cool, tell me when you break for lunch and I'll find you.
Which building are you in?
Ahah meeting Ella for lunch so will probably have one then, already had one this morning - maybe a bit too many for today HAHAHA.
Tomorrow?
Not sure if I'll have a chance to get out this afternoon, so let's do tomorrow morning around 10:30!
oh, hmm well i usually just have one in the morning anyway. is that alright?
ok!
Heading out now.
Meet you outside eckerslys.
Yeah just meet me near the CALM ZONE.
I'll be home for dinner but I'll be a bit late.
oh shit me too lol i just bought mine HAHA.
We can still meet up.
ah ok.
or ill see you later today?
ella and i will prob catch up for lunch again, did you want to join us.
She’s doing a summer intensive class this week, she gets a break at 12.30.
outside my office alright? then we can head someplace.
👌.
logged into myTimetable, they finally fixed our core class.
get your back pay first!
then tell him another offer has come up.
lol.
yeah i feel that.
dunno how much *more* social media strategy you’ll learn here (since you’d know more than all of them) but it will be more fulfilling I’d say.
You’d be doing more than posting of.
Not sure, i can ask them when they come in later.
I think it’s more of an offloading role, so some social media, some writing, mail chimp, sorting through cabinets.
haha two mins away.
yeah fair.
Depends on their budgeting, it’ll mean they have to charge you overtime.
so I kind of doubt it.
but i’ll suss it out.

He looked like he knew what he was doing, but yes I agree.

Things will get better don't worry.
Rage a bit tonight though.

It's ok, had an orientation day today so pretty tired.
Up since 5:30, so I don't mind arriving later.
￼🤔 wonder where all that money went?
🤙.
Hey didn't check beforehand and there's a couple trams that go to the depot instead of the city so I'll be running late.
Sorry.
Just missed the normal one by like 5 mins.
Feel a bit better now after a good shower and nap 💕.
I think we'll be fine ahah.
There's a lot of room at the forum.
Ok cool.
Why were you all the way out there?
Ahaha.
Just waiting at fed square, how far away are you?
Woah!!! They look amazing!!
I love the blue.
Also are we able to meet for lunch at 12 again ?
Yay! Sory I didn't bring a morning snack today and am very hungry ahah.

If you like!
I really don't mind what we eat.
But am down to try these.
Ahaha oh no!
Ok bubble tea is good.
Did you want to try one of the food places that have opened up here?
Meet at calm zone?
Yes.
Oh she's doing it another day.
Not sure if when/we're being filmed, it's supposed to be a design meeting.
HAHAHA.

Hey I won't be home for dinner tonight.
Hey not only is Lonsdale St closed but Hodfle St is having more work done - delays up to an hour!!
Is there any other way I can get to yours, maybe via the hurstbridge line?
I can take the train to eltham station, then there's a bus to warrandyte.
(or if she's not busy would your mum be so kind as to pick me up from there? Hehe ☺️)
Ok I should get there at 1:15.
Just got onto the train at Heidelberg station, will get to eltham at 1:16.
❤️🤙.
Yeah I'm at Ella's place.

Ohhh.
Yeah hope so, we get to swap tho.
Monday is data vis and lec.
Tue is studio.
Wednesday is expertise.
Yeah legit had only one class to chose ahaha.
Yeah sweet dw.
Glad you finally have a class you like lil.
Laughed at an image.
Ahaha yes I have been hired specially to draw potato men for rmit.
Nice nice typical Liam off holidaying while you do all his work.
Jkhk.
Didn't they switch over to this whole convaluted process so that it's easier for people overseas to use?
Lol you going to get a big boy tat?
The meme u just sent me.
All good here, quiet morning. I think I'll leave after lunch.
Thank you and your dad for driving me all the way back!!
Also wish Gemma a happy birthday for tomorrow, I didnt get to say goodbye.
Woah!! What do you mean, looks fantastic 😋.
That's alright!!
I had just assumed she was going to leave in the morning ahah.
I'll see you soon anyway.
That's good then.
😘mon Cherie.
Want to get coffee today?
Damn, what a shame.
Brandon must be quite saddened.
Lol sorry tagged along with co workers , we can go in the Arvo if you're free?
Ahah it's ok, just finished lunch so I might be free around 2:30.
Sure! If you want.
Where at.
Ok leaving now.
Damn, +$1000 😵.
How much was it at Dinkums)
?
Hmm.
Yeah, I don’t think they do offset but I could be wrong.
Their presses are digital inkjet, that’s all I know.
It depends ahah. I’ve never actually used offset.
It’s got a higher set-up cost.
but per run is cheaper.
Yeah, I have a feeling 300 copies might classify as a ‘short run’ but it’d be good to check it out. It’s higher quality usually.
Nah I just suggested them bc inkjet is sooo much nicer than laser, and they’re green etc.
I don’t know any good offset places unfortunately.
If you go with offset you could do 2 colours, black and something else.
That could be a good middle ground?
Can give it a bit of an ‘arty’ feel maybe?
Hey, if you have a chance today are you able to look at that Film Fatales book and see where it’s printed? Asking for Sophia.
(I think it said where on the last pages)
Ella has this cool zine that a rmit grad (and stuart ofc ) helped design, just asked her to check where it’s printed.
speaking of old mate, maybe email Stuart and see what he suggests?
lol if he suggests Blurb.
ahah the past couple of months have just disappeared.
It’ll be f i n e.
pop some adderall and get to work.
Ads?
Advertisement s?
Oh yeah I think I remember you mentioning wanting to have some advertising space.
Yeah cool.
Dunno if I can offer any expertise lol.
Yeah yeah ofc.
Can't recall.
Looking noe.
Oooh, I'm quite into it.
A bit more *surreal* than usual.
But exciting nevertheless.
Any rationale that starts with "Sooooo" is a good 1.
out office is Getting a visit from Mr bean tomorrow morning apparently.
Can't wait to get an autograph.
Ooh thank you!
How was your day with Gemma?
Documents on Call doesn't sound as sexy of a printing company lol.
Lovely 💕.
Omg lol.
Their logo is something out of word 97 clip art I love it.
Hmm yeah maybe see what Stuart suggests 😆.
Awwwww.
Soft cuddly lupi.
Ahhhh I know man.
Should have invested in Bitcoin when I had the chance.
Whadaya mean you got plenty of time.
New business idea?
Hey, it's a tech company, it's scalable - activator is sure to fund it!
Pretty much aha.
Hey we still meeting at 3:30?
Hey what time will you be in the city today?
I might be going to Sophia's design meeting at around 3:30 so I'll be leaving work early.
All g! Looking forward to it.
Me and two other guys in the office are dressed the same bloody hell.
Black t and tan shorts ffs.
HAHA.

Not great, but it’s fine.

Odd one out lol.

Why do you need one?
Immediately thought it must be something dildo related if it's a gift from you.
Yep!
Yay!! 😚💫.
Coming out now.
Ohhhh.
That explains their more pigment-y feel.
Always liked water colour pencils more ahaha.
Brush over the top usually.
Or drawing onto wet paper I think?
‼️☺️🙌.

oh dear, hope she’s feeling ok!
I’ll have to check what I’m doing sunday.

Trello, GDrive, GSheets mostly.
Mailchimp!
Mail chimp mailchimp mailchimp.

FUCK.
Keyboard and trackpad aren't responsive.
Have to finish this job by tonight lol.
Can't stop.
nah.
Maybe when I reset.
I've been using a mouse from before.
So icsnstill work.
Just no typing!!
hey sorry got stuck at work.
im still in the city.
Sorry just finished at work.
Hey just finished up here, what are you doing?
I was going to head home to eat but if you're around now we can get something in the city.
I'm happy to just go for a drink later tonight, I'll either eat something here and wait for you or go home, eat, then meet you back in they city?
Up to you- both quicker for us to get to than the city yeah?
Yeah yep let's do that.
Ok what time will you get to northcote or Preston do you think?
Ahah sorry only got out of work now.
I think I have to go into the city tomorrow anyway now - my keyboard and trackpad became unresponsive!!
Was going to meet friend after dinner but since I stayed back late I'm just going to stay in the city and eat here.
I'll see you later tonight.
Ok I'll catch the train to Preston station then meet you there?
Or do you prefer northcote?
Ehh let's go with Preston we can head to northcote later if we want.
I'm just hungry atm Ahah.
Cool see you there soon.
Ahaha I wish that was me rn 😚💕.
Same, heading past Collingwood.
Hahah all g.
Nah they won't.
Oh thank God keyboard and trackpad work again.
was with a friend last night so didn't open it after work. Putting it to sleep and waking it probably fixed it aHaha.
Loved “I told u so 😉”.
yay!!
the first chapter in the IT 101 textbook is just that, in giant text.
whats that?
pretty sure you need to complete that in order to work for them.
its like their induction process.
of course, other wise you can’t get hired.
or submit your application.
something like that.
its just a general quiz or something.
no relation to the job - just general rmit stuff.
Its never come up in an interview, my score i mean.
70% is a pass, as long as you pass thats all they need.
they prob cant even see it.
oh hmm.
legit can’t remember what my quiz was like.
ok maybe they do see your answers.
idk i guess you just write about a time that is relevant. if not just make it up and tell them what they want to heat.
hear.
it closes tomorrow doesn’t it?
the 18th.
yeah just write from experience. its my most hated part of interviews too.
i don’t know what else to say ahah i can’t give you answers.
its not like theres some secret key.
did you write a cover letter? Just think of it like that essentially.
you can probably use the same answers.
yeah so write specifically about the examples that you’ve alluded to in the cover letter.
surely there’s something from orenda you can refer to? launch parties, editing idk.
or refer to baker’s delight.
ahah.
pretend you couldn’t change it?
or use an example from school or uni.
obi not everyone has worked in an office environment.
it’s just, softening the truth… you did technically have a deadline - the party was booked in advance no?
you had to take into account printing time.
some of your writers were being lazy.
not responding.
perhaps - but they’re not going to get you to hire food trucks in this job so you don’t have to worry.
or if you do now you can prove that you know the requirements.
works both ways.
just spin your failures into ‘learning experiences.
‘.
its fine.
if anything they’ll use these as prompt questions in the interview.
so you can explain yourself better then.
Hmm no I think that sounds good.
You could say, it was all successful despite some last minute problems with the venue that I was able to overcome.
Ahaha.
Majic.
Nah, def magic.
Sorry was having a shower and left phone to charge 😓.
No turns out we aren't doing anything tomorrow.
So I can come over if you like!
Disliked “Provide an example of a time when you have worked as a part of a team in a workplace
My previous role of Salesperson at Baker's Delight required me to work as a part of a team in a workplace, especially during close shifts. Each of us had designated tasks to complete within a certain timeframe, to ensure the store was secure, clean, organised, hygienic and that the financial records were maintained. We would rotate roles or choose roles based on expertise or personal preference. One such role included disposing of the unused product, securing the front doors, cleaning the front cabinets, cleaning the bread slicer, ensuring general tidiness, sweeping and mopping. If one team member finished our tasks early or was struggling to complete them, the other team members would assist to ensure that the job was done to a high standard and on time.
It was important that we completed these tasks to a high standard. If we didn't, we would be letting down other team members when they arrived early the next morning and would make the next day's work inefficient, delayed, unsafe or impossible to do. If we didn't complete them efficiently, we wouldn't be paid overtime.”.

Disliked ““Provide an example of a time when you have worked as a part of a team in a workplace
Each issue of Orenda Magazine requires working in a remote team. Between Issues 1 and 6, the team has grown from 9 to 45 people, with a mix of previous and new Contributors each time. For our current issue, six, I have systematised the way we work to ensure maximum efficiency. This requires working with teams of writers, designers, artists and general team members, and ensuring each part integrates well and that everyone is on the same page. Each core team member has specific specialities which are maximised, and I can rely on them to complete tasks efficiently and to a high standard. “ I don’t think this is right tbh”.
Yeah go with the bottom one.
Tonight's white night too innit?
Maybe, it's always so busy.
I think there's something up at the Carlton gardens Nat your place, maybe we can just go there if we want.
Midnight picnic.
AHA yeah good don’t mention that.

Goodnight! Thank you for inviting me over today ❤️.
(still waiting for the shower, had to wait for dad and brother to go first 😒)
I usually go in at that time ahaha.
No, too late...
Did you need me to go past Officeworks today?
Saw a poster for this on the way to work - free dim sum and doggos!
yeah!
My boss is wearing yeezy's.
Sort of impressed that as a 40+ quirky cultural sector worker she pulls them off.
Oh yeah all the kids these days are saying "I'll get Stacie to action that" and "it's time for our 10:00 weekly huddle".
Maybe, ill be working on the event that day so I might be pretty wiped out.
Gold, what size?
If you buy it online, I can pick it up from the QV store.
When you add it to your cart chose click and collect, I can get it this afternoon.
Otherwise if you tell me exactly the one she wants I’ll just buy it on my card.
It’s cheaper at office works anyway.
434.
ok cool.
ah sorry, I’m a bit too busy today.
Haha it's ok.
Orientation is this week so everything for that is done P much.
Found out they're going to keep me on after next week! Working on my two days off.
Working class boi.
In a cushy plus minimum wage office job.
AHAH.

Also they're looking for an intern to do social media stuff I got Sophia to apply so she might be working here too.
Loved an image.
Got it, coming home now.

UMM xcuse me huny *I* get all *my* news from Married at First Sight!
Are you able to come into the city tomorrow evening? Working on the event on Wednesday so I prob won't see you until Thurs otherwise.
Yep!

When you get a tiny oil stain from your cream pasta on your light pink shirt, right in the middle 😓😖.
That's ok!
Ok!
Having dinner in city tonight.
Hey sorry I know it's a bit last minute but would tomorrow afternoon/evening be ok?

Got a bit mixed up Monday thought tomorrow was the event.
Ok cool.
Otherwise I could do Friday.
Ok!
👌.
Hey at your interview make sure you talk up your webmaster/WordPress/Squarespace skills.
Just saying 👀.
Just something I overheard I think they're looking for someone to update the creative sites? They're debating whether or not they should put out another job posting.
Interviews are next week she said.
Orientation for what?
Sice when do we have orientation?
0h hmm.
Just saw it.
We didn't have it last year did we? Maybe I didn't go.
Yeah I have a 1:30 class too.
There's an expertise class at 1:30 so hopefully it won't run too long over.
Betting it's just David being all like, you gotta work hard lol.
Or probs just explaining capstone.
Ty!
feeling better, thank you! ❤️.
how are you?
Most people are in bundoora today, at *that* event ahah.
Brunswick was yesterday, so it’s been rather quiet here this week.
Yeah I know 😵.
Loved an image.
Just ran into kat.
Was walking outside and she was coming back from work.
She's good!
Hates working for her family ahah.
But she's been promoted to the cash register now.
￼Went to the library on Monday.
👀.
Also overheard in the office that the intern may need to do some web editing/ WordPress /Squarespace.
So I told Sophia to talk that up in the interview.
👀👀.
Me too! A bit nervous bc I think they'd get quite a lot of responses.
But she also mentioned to that lady she knew on my team that she'd applied.
Also I think I got Elly a little job too lol? Ahah.
The dance lady runs her own studio and she needed some animated titles. Asked in the group chat and Tristan suggested her!
I'm the jobs fairy 😇.
😚💫.
Thank you! I'll try!
Sorry I don't think I'm going to come out tonight, up since 5:30 just want to have a quiet one.
The watered down cider isn't calling for me tonight ahah.
No worries, thank you! Getting it now.
Nup.
Good thank you! Just got on the tram back home.
No it finished at 2.
Haha tyty 💖 can I see you tomorrow night?
After work.
😚.
Was in the campus store helping run the scavrnyhubt from 12:40 onwards so missed the hottest part of the day phew 😌.
Ahah yes they did.
No bombs today.
Just got home now lol.
Ok thank u.
Looking forward to them in fact!!
Oh no!! 😖.
Yeah me too lol.
Saw about 70 of them.
AHHAHA.
Yeah we printed the blue on the back.
So it's double sided now.
Agreed 😅.
dunno. I do know we’ve had orientation the past three days so everyone was under the pump this week.
lynda’s been working till 7//8.00 most days this week so yeah highly doubt she’s had a spare moment to look through the applications.
No it’s us.
Careers is just a web portal.
don’t think they do HR.
managers have to sort out their own staff.
nah all g.
had a message from elly asking about that animation thing and i was like, ahah calm down nobody has had a spare moment this week.
it will probably happen next week tbh.
but i can ask when lynda comes in.
hey is it alright if we reschedule for 4?
sorry I’ve just got to finalise a few things today bc i won’t be back in the office for a while.
i have my studio then so it’ll have to be after 3.30.
but yeah otherwise thats fine.
👍.
no clue.
but looks likesomebody just won 50,000 velocity points.
I love how Andy always ends his emails with "look forward to seeing everyone, with snacks".
I wonder if it's a hint 🤔.
Ahah yes that's right 💖.
Also I forgot yesterday but ill.be doing that video thing with Sophia.
At 4, not sure how long it will be but I'll try and leave by 5:30.
How long will the video take do you think?
Ok cool.
Yeah Sophia said it should only take 30 mins so I'll see you after!
🌟.
Yeeeeee boiiii.
yay! good luck!
Coming now!
Yep coming down now!
Where are U?
Ok!
Meeting notes:
- illustrations w/ transparent background (tiff or flattened PSD)
- sync book file at start and end of design process instead.
- major revisions (1.3 -> 2.0) ready for approval.
- Sophia to write media kit and Adrian to put it together this week.
Almost there.
All g I don't think he'll mind. He prob knew you'd get it over him.
No we'll be eating here.
Hey when is the national is it next week?
Didn't put it down in my calendar.
Ok cool.
How did you go on orientation find any food lol?
Hey I just realised that next Thursday Im going to a concert. And next Saturday we have a wedding 😓😵😖.
Following weekend I've got a relative's 2nd birthday, then my brother's birthday the weekend after that 💀.
So I'm not sure if I can find a good time to go away 😭.
Ahaha yeah well there would have been so many more people today so they prob had to ration it.
No there were about 15 of us working.

AHHAHA.
I Only have about 12-13 contact hours, I think they said something about doing the same amount at home or something...
Problem with having just afternoon classes is it's hard to really do anything in the mornings lol.
In slightly better news you can come over tomorrow anytime.
Are you upset? 😞😓.
yeah, at my nonna’s. mentioned it yesterday.
my bloody home printer is pissing me off lol.
prints the right colours on a test page, but on the actual doc it gives up.
Yeah it's all fine.
Even when I print the colour bars around the outside, those are right but the content is wrong still!
Darkest part of the image should be that dark blue swatch.
Anyway I need to finish this tonight I'm just going to settle with cyan lol.
Ok.
So weird...
Printed it as an image too.
I know I hate them so much.
But love printed stuff.
Ahaha the curse of the print designer.
I know I'm sorry... I bought the tickets in early December when.

Ok ughhh hmm.
Are you making the magazine then??
Yeah so it sounds like they'll send you the files this Wednesday, then you have to finish it by the following yeah? It's so poorly worded lol jaha.

Hey sooo... Would it be ok if maybe I gave my national tickets to yoon?
Ahaha I'd like to go, it's just that I've got those two days off work and Ella was thinking of going away woops.
I forgot abt the show until I saw an ad for it and the next couple weekends I've got some family things on during the weekend 😞.
Ahahahhhh.
Hmm damn I don't want to ditch you alone look it's fine don't worry about it actually.
We'd both feel bad AHAHA.

Got treated to some late 90s/2000s net art in the lecture today:
Morning ☺️.
Oh what?! Silly teacher.
Ok ill see you at lunchtime then.
Andy: "don't use muse".
Put your hand up if you tried muse and it turned you off.
Andy is letting the class run over not sure when we'll break.
Actually he just realised.
Ok !
Andy: "this was Indra's work. It was really smart, really!" ❤️.
Haha he's made reference to you a few times it's very sweet.
Sjw Indra fighting the good fight.
Fuk.
Pete evens 2.0.
Fuuuuk.
Jezus.
Fake bougie white hipster (me) woke.
Exciting! Haven't done anything yet but enjoying listening to Andy talk and ramble of course it's very inspiring.
Lol that wasn't the one abt public relations was it? British speaker dude?
Haha I think I started watching it once bc I had seen another of his doco's.
Its like borderline conspiracy bit for cosmopolitan liberals.
Yeah that's the one I saw.
I watched it after trump won it was like d U d E.
Yeh system.
Way.
Wat.
Wut.
Wot.
Keep cups?
Fuck me.
😭.
Expect to see you out with the socialists by next week.
Trully times have changed, advertising is WOKE NOW BABY.

Loved an image.
No just got home sorry.
ah lol.
oh well.
Loved an image.
Awww 😌.
❤️💫⚡️♨️🤙💕.
So sweet so pure.
I think that's fine, no one in the office except the project manager wears a suit.
And even then it's not regularly.
Just think what would beck wear.
I think I wore chinos to the interview, but like it wasn't 28/30 deg back then sooo.
Yeah probs. But I mean is she usually has a nice top and either slim jeans or trousers.
Yeah I think the oldies have a certain expectation of formality, that's not really the case anymore unless you're in finance or something??!
I doubt Lynda would really care, last intern dressed sorta normcore like men's t tucked into black jeans soooo.
Wear what you would wear to a meeting with someone from activator.
Different parts of the uni would have different vibes I guess.
So jeans/top combo would fit in fine here.
I just think a suit looks too intense lol.
Like woah, serious vibes here.
Ahaha.
Nice.
Trust your gut.
Personally I think if they're trying to get a sense of what you're like to work with/personality, smart casual is a better indication.
Ahah it will go fine just try and not think too much abt it.
What time is it?
Pm? Oh wow that's so late!
Lol k.
Well I'll be around in the morning (need to get a haircut ahah) so if you wanna chill lmk.
Or have someone help u breathe.
Do you have some examples of work you can show in the interview?
I know it's not a graphic design job but maybe like social media stuff?
Orenda definitely.
AHHAHA great minds.
Yeah I guess, looks a bit more profesh if you have it all ready tho.
And can project it onto the screen in the meeting rooms.
Screenshot -> pdf on your laptop maybe?
Ahaha sorry.
Was just thinking abt mine and they liked being able to look at my portfolio on the tv.
Perhaps.
Yeah I guessed.
Guess.
Yeah just to help visualise what you've done.
I usually find having a visual prompt is helpful when I'm talking.
But otherwise screenshots on your phone would be fine.
Even just doing the quickview thing.
Nah missed my tram so still on my way lol.
Yeah agree that's easier ahah.
Hopefully I'll be done by 11:30/11:40.
I'll let you know we can meet up when I'm done.
Sophia's interview is today at 12:15 wish her luck!
Aha just arrived now, got to wait a little while though.
Me?! Ahaha shit.
My ruse is up.
AHAH.
it should be fine, I've mentioned to Lynda I have a friend applying and beck knows I know you?
Omg ofc.
I'm not head on tho so maybe they won't notice? 😜.
Jokes they prob will.
Can't get rid of me.
💫⚡️💕.
Nah it should be fiiiine.
Having it now.
Yeah.
It will go fine! Dw.
Done! Where's your meeting?
Not sure where room 3 is but 4 is where connect is.
You sure it's not 35/36 or something?
Wait I'll look around.
Hmm can't seem to find a 3 on level 4...
￼These are the project rooms they usually use.
Found it.
I'll wait by the giant pixel.
Wtf do you keep in here it weighs a ton.
It's ok beck has seen it just show them the pdf.
Hey what time are you getting here today?
Oh, no I've got 1 to 4.
It's all g.
Got here early for a haircut, now just minding Sophia's stuff during her interview.
Ahaha it's not that exciting.
Shorter than kat would want but like.
I think she wants me to have a flowing mane.
Or whatever.
After this wedding perhaps.
😙💕😜.
Haha.
Eating a fallafel salad from last night - jealous? ✨.
Oh dear 😞😵😖.
Silly bus.
😃.
In building 9 level 2.

Hey we just finished, where is your class at?
Oh good.
Indra wants a coffee from standing room in mc.
We are standing by the state library.
Ok ill wait for you.
Want to take a look?
Went past cos, there are two there that I liked: $99. Went past Marc's too but wasn't that much cheaper and didn't fit as well.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Just plain white.
Formal looking.
Do you have the jacket out, are you able to send a picture to remind me?
Not a big deal otherwise.
Thanks.
Ok heading back now.
Had a snack after class at 4 and shared some chips with Ella at 6, so not very hungry though.
Yeah will.
Maybe. Going away with Ella tomorrow, back sometime Friday. So not sure if I'll go to the launch or not.
But I'd like to!
Won't be able to stay late bc I have a wedding on Saturday lol.

Hmm.
Bride and groom dancing to Ed Sheeran 🤢😝.
Hehe.
Hmm... I like your handwriting tho 😊.
Although I get if you wouldn't want to - I'd feel the same ahah.
Maybe tell them you're not 100% happy with it and would prefer a typeface.
Yeah maybe you're right.
Did you find and inline font? Personally I liked the Mrs eaves you picked first instead.
1at rule of working with bad client ideas... Make their idea look worse than the one you actually want haha.
Hmm do they not like the normal Mrs eaves?
I think it looks very nice with the plants 💕.
Ah ok.
Hmm well they can't be too picky 🤔.
You could turn the rest of your plant drawings into repeat patterns or something!
For their website?
Oohh! Exciting!!
Do show ✨.
Mmm.
Still looks delicious.
Yeah still going.
Just playing all the 80s tunes.
But not the good ones lol.

I got dragged up for one song but not my kind of jams haha.
dunno if you’re still looking for printers but i came across this one while searching for something completely different.
yeah it was nice.
so damn hot during the day tho.

Hey so is class at 1 or 1.30 now?
Ah ok. Yeah that girl was complaining so I wasn't sure lol.
Poor Karen now can't pick up her kids in time.
Um I posted that first bag thing we did. Someone else in our group documented the group one so I don't have a recording of it ahah.
Think it's to be done before class. Which is why I'm doing it now 💀.
Back on my old shit.
I think I'm going to use my brother's bookshelf, nothing of mine has any order to it fuck.

Estranged from the family.
So selfish.
Ah ok, well if we do I'll come and find you like last time 💖.
Hmmm 😖.
Yeah I guess...
But rude of them not to send out a "thanks but no thanks" e-mail.
Well we'll know for sure by Thursday when i rock up and see either u or somebody else in the interns desk 😝.

Walked past a store and had a pang of longing 💫✨💕👌😚.
Ie. All of Stephen's lectures.
Also sorry about before,  Ella wasn't feeling ok after class - stayed and made her feel better.
👌.

Are you and everyone ok?
Jesus.
Lol.
Oh my gos.
On the freeway??
Yes perhaps.
Ahh maybe for the best? Your seemed a bit stressed tonight?
That's so shit.
No chance of rescheduling?
Loved an image.
I need to find more cute animals to respond with 😔.
Did you get home alright? No more wayward mattresses?
That's ok, it's the least I can do when I'm the one that makes you feel like that in the first place 😖☹️.
I'm sorry if I ever make you feel like I don't love you as much as I do...
Bc I do!!
So much! 💕😁😚.
No one else is just like you, no one else can replace you!
I just want to make you happy.
Happy and warm ❤️♨️.
Omg lol going thru Tumblrs for Andy's and he continued to 100 Q's book LOL I thought he would have given up after that cluster fuck.
Let's hope last year's 1st years were more organised than we were HAHa.
Hey sooo I just read an email from Andy reminding us that tomorrow we're spending the morning at the Docklands library.
We may be back for lunch or we may stay the whole day - he hasn't decided 😔.
So hopefully I'll see you at lunchtime if we come back otherwise I'll have to see you after class? 😓✨💋.
☹️.
Yes certainly will!!
If we have a long enough break I may even be able to come back ❤️.
Sweet dreams 😚💖🌝.
Hey sorry, had to leave before the washing machine finished.
Yeah no sorry, we're staying here until 2.
So I'll see you after!
😔❤️.
Andy got featured in dazed once, highlight of his career.
Ok!
Oh thank God 😁.
Ahaha sonfickong stressful jesus.
same  tho.
ahah yeah that phrasing is a bit odd - makes it sound like they’ve got someone else.
but it could just be protocol that they have to be vague.
Finished now, coming up via tram. When does your class end?
Ok! Ill putter around until then.
I think on the brief it said something about covers?
Let me check hold on.
Nothing yet. Watched a Shakespeare movie as research ahah.
Yeah so it says to brainstorm concepts, imagery, type etc. It also says that in tomorrow's class we'll be doing pin ups of our ideas.
I have a note I made that says 'covers ready' so I'm going to work on those tonight.
Which play are you doing?
Think I might do Richard 3, haven't read it or any of the others either.
It seemed the less common one, could be interesting.
Yeah not sure what I'm going to do - have a few thoughts but nothing I'm excited about.
It's funny, my school picked the most obscure ones to study HAHA.
Merchant of Venice? Like who even knows that one.
Same!
Ditto.
Also I don't really have a ~concept~ either grrr feel like I'm just stabbing in the dark.
Ok! I'm just in building 8.
I can meet you elsewhere?
I'll wait for you in the b 9 foyer.
It's something!!
Haven't left the city yet so you're well ahead of me still!
Hahaha priorities.
Nah I'm good thanks, I'm so tired from wandering around and I need to eat fuck.
Ahaha.
Yes exactly.
Had my studio, we had class down at the Docklands library bc we're doing some work with them.
It's pretty cool! Got a big maker space with 3d printers, music rooms, electronics, vr.
All for free.
Who was your day? Get much done?
Yeah probs.
It should be fine.
We'll probably spend most time learning how to make books.
It's not too bad.
She showed us when I had her last year.
Although saying this I did stuff mine up at the time HAHAHA.
Friday!
😝.
Sorry I fell asleep.
Are you ok? Manage to get any rest?
Was going to do some more work on the covers this morning maybe we can meet too?
Ahh ok 😔 best to get your rest ❤️.
See you😚.
Miss you 💕✨.
Damn 😔.
I'm sorry 😕.
😍.
So adorable!!! ✨💕.
U feeling better?
Awww.
Sending digital hugs.
👐.
Hey we're down Elizabeth St so let us know when you finish class.
We had a 2 and a half hour book binding lesson today 😩.
Very helpful tho.
Just buying some materials now.
Haha no Shayna is quite entertaining.
Yep went past there! Got some book board.
Lincraft has good thread so we just left there.
Yep!
Need to get some paper soon, kW Doggett is now in Dandenong!! ☹️.
So weary 😝.
☹️😚.
There's another place in Southbank that's got good paper.
Not for printing unfortunately...
Yeah all like water colour or lino.
Also we need to get A LOT of sheets ahaha.
To mock up an entire blank book.
Yeah I saw a pick - nicer cover but same font lol.
Also he did another food event HAHAH.
Lol dieter would turn in his grave.
I think they toned it down a bit last year tho - no meal they just had a good related exhibition?
So like what 90% of the group's did last time I guess. Bc only a few had anything to do with the salad.
Also where are you at currently? Finished class?
We are done shopping, we'll head up to Shanghai village and meet you there?
Sweet, still on the tram.
Corey is stuck at work but is James joining?!
👌.
We are upstairs.
Yeah!

For waffles.
Hey I'm good for you to call/message me now.
Adrianfranzese@gmail.com.
Everybody loves you, it's ok.
I'd prefer to talk when I'm not at home - I can wait for you to finish dinner.
One moment I'm in the toilet hehe.
I'll find a quiet spot then call.
Just remembered I left my book board at yours can I grab it tomorrow?
Or Friday?
Yeah no worries.
I'm getting dinner W Ella after work so I may get it after that if that ok...
Save me lugging a giant board to our date haha.
Haha sweet.
Nice 👌.
I told Ella about how you didn't get the job, she's really sad for you ☹️
"I don't understand why the universe isn't showering get with goodness".
😁☺️.
Are you feeling ok about it, we didn't really discuss it today.
Yeah, no we were excited too. Still don't get why they didn't pick you. But it's ok.
Was thinking maybe this could be a good(ish) thing. Wasn't very flexible and you kind of need that to be able to work on both Orenda and uni work!
So perhaps something else will come up that's more suited to your needs. Also possible that you may get passed along as a candidate if a similar position elsewhere pops up?
Like don't bet on it but that's how I my current job and a similar thing happened to Ella's sister at ANU.
Yeah the pay was hard to beat.
I know.
It's this in between that's hardest.
Don't fret ahaha!
It'll pass.
It's been a tough stressful week for you unfortunately ❤️.
🎥 Eric Andre- C'est La Vie - YouTube.
Sorry that phrase makes me think of this lol.
Sure ok, what time is it?
Ok.
I have my own lunch so I'll have that beforehand.
But let me know when you want to gp.
Yep!
That's ok.
I don't mind ahaha.
It's ok!
They're not in today.
Ye probably havent started yet.
hey would you be interested in working at Little Print?
Ran into one of the guys they asked if i knew anyone interested.
its working in the store, they need someone to help print, design etc.
yeah next store.
yeah, thought i’d check with you first. I’m going to tell Tristan too if that’s ok hahah.
he said just go past and drop your cv off in the next few days.
yeah that’s what i was thinking. since he worked in the dinkum store i thought they would prob prefer him, that’s why i am checking with you first.
who knows, they may want a social media person once they see what you do.
i know hahah.
yeah maybe, although i think he is also looking for something that actually pays.
Hey I ran into one of the guys from Little Print (next to Melb Artist Supplies)
And they are looking for someone to help in the store.
Working two days I think? They didn't say which but they will probably be flexible.
You'd be helping to print, design, etc.
Since you used to work at Dinkums U thought you'd be a shoe in.
* I thought.
Also I hwsr you need an internship too? Maybe tell them and they may be able to set it up as an "internship".
But I thought you'd also be interested in something that ACTUALLY PAYS.
👌.
All g.
Are you doing the internship next semester, is that why you were looking before?
Ah yes, ofc ofc.
Yeah that would be great. If I see anything I'll send it over. Best to look for it this semester, no one was hiring over the mid year break 😕.
Nah, not as an elective.
If I find something tempting I may apply, but dunno how I'll manage. Unless it's during the holidays.
Yeah I've noticed HAHA.
yeah, I'm doing Artist books as my sem 2 elective and don't want to drop that.
There's no real plus to doing the intern subject, aside from having a lighter class load.
Imo.
Yep HAHA.
fills up an elective slot I guess.
Tell me abt it.
✨💕💫.
🤷‍♂️.
That's ok I don't mind! ❤️.
Just need to take a poster out of its frame haha.
Won't be long.
💕 adios ☺️.
👋🤙.
We've got king krule tomorrow night remember, sans Indra ☹️😢.
Boost is getting into Bitcoin now 🤦‍♂️.

Ah sweet.
Easy easy baby blue.
〰️🎷〰️.
Lol was supposed to send that to Ella.
Fuck.
Not that incriminating.
Just cringe.
HAHA.
she said that to me first.
That's my excuse.
Hey.
Disappointed that you accepted it so readily.
Easy easy baby blue.
〰️🎷〰️.
Sent this to kat by mistake.
Had my glasses off.
💀.
Prob true.
I forgot to put the caterpillar in it.
No.
I can't remember the context to any of this.
It truly is good tho.
Something like that.
I like to think this is what they meant by it.
👌 it's safe w me.
Woah early.
Yes I have 👌.
Very much.
A new u!
Tonight has showed both the best and worst of me.
Which means your worst is yet to happen?
🤷‍♂️.

Oh ok lol.
Damn.
Ah ok.
I'll find you inside?
Your shirt or Dan's?
How sweet.

Sounds lovely 💕✨.
〰️〰️〰️🎷.
They had a saxophonist who took a stage dive at the end 😱.
To my knowledge no - but I could be mistaken.
Very likely.
Ok, we went back into the city for a snack so I'll be home later than I would be otherwise, sorry.

That's ok, the (average sized) wienners somewhat made up for it 👌.
Miss u ❤️⭐️.

Anything on for today?
Oh that's lovely! Very sweet 💫.

Have to get started soon I guess 😬.
Very true, very hard to stop.
Yeah, going on a picnic w Ella.
Why'd you ask?
Ah, interesting! If you can be bothered coming all the way to Heidelberg!
Loved an image.
Did a bit of tidying up in my room and I'm already tired 😩.
Ahaha that's ok ill see what Ella wants to do.
Sure am 💕.
Hey how did the tatt go?! ✨⭐️🐉🗡⭐️✨.

Haha lol poor guys.
Yeah! He was great 💕 unless that makes you feel bad, in which case he was shit.
Dan said the night he went krule was being a bit bitchy, like didn't talk at all, moody etc etc.
Complete opposite for us tho.
Saxophonist took a stage dive, fell head first, then re-surfaced for the encore.
Good morning ⭐️☺️.

I just haven't had a chance during the week to do anything 😓.
I know! He was asleep for half of it!!
I tried making a test book last night, made the spine too big tho so it won't close lol.
So spoiled.
Nah it's all g, needed to practice so idm doing it again.
Yeah same fuck.
Was talking to kat abt it, that one with all the speaking symbols was haunting us.
Like how do we compare with that?!?!
Very cool.
New grouper song is very pretty.
Mind link 〰️❤️〰️.
She is a very Sunday morning kind of artist ✨.
Ooh what type?!

HAHa very strange folks about...

Yep all good.
It doesn't have a dress code does it?
I'm just going to wait at uni and do some work.
What have you got for class tomorrow?
Fyi paper point isn't too far from the city, has pretty good options and does a student discount!
Hey Dad, I'm just waiting around at rmit. What time will you head over to Maha?
Would it be alright if I leave my bags in your car? I bought some paper today also so want to keep it safe.
Ah no it's ok I'll drop it off in mum's car otherwise.

I know you do.
I meant what are you bringing in? 😅.
What happened??
So full and tired...
😑.
🅱️lease 💕.
Screen printing quote came back 💀😭.
There goes that idea.
just under $60 for one print, need 2 designs so that will be at least $120.
my cover.
but i can go to impact digital (the ones we were using for RMIT) and they should be able to print in both silver and bright red.
mostly just wanted to try it out for fun.
hopefully these guys won’t be very expensive, never done any speciality inks before.
if we’re willing to drop $200 on a screen printing kit - sure!
or sneak into the screen printing facilities at rmit.
from eckerslys i think.
hahah true!
I'll explain in class?
Not much happening tho we just in groups.
Hey is it ok if we meet at 12 instead today?
Woke up not feeling so well 😣.
I think so just woke up with a good.
Colf.
Cold.
Had a shower feel a bit better.
fitbaseline.
Np!! Good to know I'm not the only one doing it before class.
Yeah no worries.
It's just how I like to work, nothing special abt it.
i don’t know whats happening but ok.
Haha not surprised and was considering it myself lol.
Yeah I can hang around for a bit after.
👉👉.
Hahaha ok good to know.
Fuck I think I'm coming down with something feel so sick today 😓.
Worst timing.
Still going to class tho I ain't that bad.
Human shield.
Except spice.
Ok!
Still in Carlton so maybe 10 mins??
Usually catch the tram from swanston St so idm.
dw I’m dead too.
Hey are u around? Just left class.
?
Good luck, going to head home not feeling too well today 👍.
No left class now, am waiting for my tram.
Have you finished?
60 A3 + student discount was only like $36.
But if you're doing a5 exactly maybe just get A4 for the inside and a3 for the cover??
👉👉✨.
Yeah I don't know either, the test book I made is 28 pages and is about thw right thickness.
Haven't squashed it yet so may shrink.
Definitely won't need 100. Unless you stuff up 😭.
The thread is only abt $3 I think.
Still waiting ... 😄.
I tried looking into screen printing they quoted be $60 a print and 6 week's turnaround 💀💀💀💀.
Take out a mortgage for this class fml.
Oh really? At dinkums??
Not that they're any good but.
Heading home now sorry, see u tomorrow night!!
Actually it's very full.
All good!!

Thanks!
Ahah nah I don't think I can. I'm just on my way to work now bc I needed to sleep in a bit.
Had tacos last night tho!
Sorry.
Yep ok!
Pick a place to eat 💕.
Ah forgot abt that...
I think I was going to go over to Ella's? Not sure yet.
Hmm hakata will def be busy.
I'm happy to try the gyoza place, it's not expensive is it?
Ok that's fine 👌✨.
Easy easy baby blue 💕.
Loved “A burger but it has a very large hash brown instead of meat.. 🙈”.
Yummm.
Ok just waiting for a file to export!
Going to an RMIT exhibition tonight bao just getting dinner with Ella.
See you later.
Reckon you'd like this guy, 👉👉.
Haha it's good innit.
Just came back from the experimental jetset exhibition, check that out to when you get the chance.
He does done stuff for RMIT, but more for architecture Interestingly.
Ahah all g. Yeah at the design hub. Wanted to go to the talk but I was working 😑 probably wont have been interesting.
Yeah I liked it! Very cool exhibition design 👌ideas were a bit heavy, so don't have a hot take yet lol.
Hahaha fuck it was like 40 bucks!!
Longer actually, finishes early may.
Yeah yeag.
Very good.
Are you going to the book fair at some point? I was thinking of going Sunday with ella.
Ohhh yeah did our guys make a book for it?
Did you guys.
Pm? I'll see if I can swing buy, I'll probably have to pay tho.
Oh jeez.
Would get but 3 bucks 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃.
Not Fuego at all.
🙏🙏🙏.
Yeah maybe, not even I can handle all those peaches 😄.
hell yesss.
tacos for 1?
hahah meal planning us usually healthy but ok.
oh shit are they doing them both now? fuck yeah.
oh yeah, breakfast even.
I’m proud of u.
also my mum just realised whoopie goldberg isn’t gay?
I’m pretty sure?
not that my mother would be up with all that.
She prob assumed bc she wears pants and has a low voice 😛.
jk mum.
ur alright.
i know there’s the one where she’s a nun. basically it’s like school of rock but in a nunnery? I think??
and another one where she has a dinosaur detective sidekick??
I’m not really sure whats going on w his shoes.
like i get that he has big toes, but how does he fit them into converse?
and why is she in all latex?
ok wait so she gets put into a nunnery as part of a witness protection program, bc her bf commits a murder.
and she teaches them to sing in the church choir.
but her talent for teaching music ultimately leads to her undoing, when her and the nuns get famous and her murdeous bf finds her.
she’s probably hung over at some point.
but alas, no jack black.
oh shit maggie smith is in the nun movie.
we all have our lows i guess.
it’s fucking terrifying and i want to have a movie marathon of all these films.
somewhere jim henson is crying.
mostly.
OK WAIT so theres a sequel to the nun one where she DOES go teach music in a school.
yes pls.
by the members of the school board, yes.
dunno.
this was before i think.
i feel like every hollywood comedy has the red text, white background, peering over sunglasses.
ah yes.
thats true.
Oh yeah I've heard about this.
Movie posters should be such a fun thing to make, but i feel like thats never the case.
I mean like they are all driven by marketing and which actor is paid the most.
So you end up just having a bunch of floating heads on top of some explosions.
Ok you got me there.
Ah ok. Last year when kat did it they made a riso printed book.
Ok! I'm going to Ella's tonight after work so I doubt I'll be coming past. Will definitely be going Sunday though!
See you then 👍.
If I leave around 5, takes about an hour to get to yours does it? So around 6?!
On the pines 🚌.
Ooh Yumm!!
I don't mind! May be a bit chilly for a picnic tho.
Oh haha oh poor Jo.
Ohhh why???
Hmmm.
Is it bc I'm coming over?
Is it short notice??
Oh.
Hahah.
Busy busy.
Well I don't mind a bit of mess.
I won't even notice.
✨💕😽.
Still on Hoddle st.
Should I catch the warrandyte bus when I get off at the pines? Is your mum not able to drive?
Ok!
Uh not sure.
I'm off if it now.
Did my location not send?
I shared it when I got on the bus.
All goos.
At the pines now.
Where should I wait?
Ok!
Left or right entrance?
Near the library?
Or the other side.
I think I'm in the wrong sude.
Ok.
Yeah all good, had dinner. Feeling better today just a bit blocked.
I should be back around 2 today.
Hey did I leave a green Stanley knife and metal ruler on your table after Wednesdays class?
😽✨.
How's your night?
Ooh lovely.
Yeah just waiting on desert.
Haha did you take it though?? All g if not I'll get another one tomorrow.
I was thinking around 12:30?
Haha no stress! Just wanted to know if I had left it at school or lost it at home. 😄.
I'm going to buy some more paper tomorrow beforehand too.
I was going to go earlier haha.
But 1 is fine.
Heyo planning on going to paper point tomorrow morning W Tristan and Sophia around 11, and then we should be back for the book fair at 12:30!
I won't take long bc I know exactly what I need so I'll leave early if they are taking too long 🙃.
Still here at the restaurant 😆.
I know!!
Very long dinner.
Even the waiters are leaving ajaha.
Most likely ❤️⚡️.
You going to bed now?
Of course 🙃.
😮so cute ✨.
What there's more!
Ok you're definitely not going to be going to bed soon.
😁.
😽.
🌚💕😴.
Love you too!!
Get well soon 💕😽😴.
Did you find him yet?
Good!
Spent a bit too much money AHAHA woops.
A Korean graphic design mag, two or three little zines, oh and one of Karen/Andy's books ❤️.
I didn't see any robots either!
Mauve they were on later but Karen showed me these little booklets drawn by the machines.
Yes I will!
Are you feeling a bit better?
Awwww 😕😔.
Did you manage to sleep a bit?
Awww, 😢.
Is it a lot ? Or.
👍 good idea.
Hmmm oh dear.
Muse.
Problem child of the Adobe suite.
Hehe yes.
Oh well I'm sure that one has its problems too.
Hey did you end up getting your die cut stuff?
Oh haha damn.
Well you got it now! What is it like a special Blade?
Ahah all g dw abt it.
I still need to finish my design fuck fuck going to print tomorrow morning 🙃✨💀😓.
Haha ok so from what I understand Maddie has gone and filled out the rest of the spreadsheet with info from the Triennial labels.
So we have names, dates, media etc.
Tristan said today he might mess around with the Instagram API and see what he can do.
I sent it in the chat.
Lemme find it.
Whole class!
But it doesn't seem like any other groups have contributed so idk what everyone else is doing??
I think the prez is week 5 yeah?
Not sure either HAHA.
Fuck I'm not really sure tbh.
I'll read her email again.
But we just were to collect data between these classes.
Nah all good look I haven't done contributed much either tbh this book has been freaking me out.
Oh shit.
That night was a shambles from what I heard.
They're supposed to have videos projected but the one guy in charge of digital screens at rmit was like Sorry not my job anymore, and the new guy is sick today so tuff tiddies.
Don't know anyone in the catwalk club but know Beck who helps organise the art clubs.
Anyway back tomorrow, we're going to use the data to make group data vizs, just like lo fi ones. But she hasn't explained that to us so it's definitely not tomorrow.
😱.
😏👉👉✨.
Laughed at “🔥😎🔥 [ me walking through flames ]”.
Still feeling crappy?
Rest up tonight 💕.
😘🤧.
Fuuuuckkk work you to the bone for nothing then don't even thank you for it that's just plain rudd.
Rude.
Loved an image.
No I think your email was fair, and at the very least she'll learn not to take advantage next time.
This sort of thing happens fairly often unfortunately, so it's good to call it out when it happens.
Ok.
How are you going with your book?
Tristan Sophia and I are (maybe) going to stay back tomorrow night to do some binding if ya wanna join.
oh haha lucky for you (prob the smart option tho)
yeah feel free to stay back.
no pressure!
ok!
gotta print 1.
I need to go early too.
maybe.
still haven’t heard from CCC.
but I know from Polly that they print Gold/silver.
just a matter of price 😟.
That one time I went in first year yeah they were not great.
Otherwise I think I'll just do gloss at Impact Digital.
Except it's in Brunswick.
No not very far, right next to the train station.
Yeah, didn’t realise but it sounds like a laserjet only thing.
Oh wow fuck that.
Can't believe this.
Like.
I think you made yourself pretty clear in your email.
Are you going to bother calling or just leave it??
Hmm I was planning to get to uni around 9:30, if you don't want to meet that early I can see you later?
Yeah fair enough.
It's hard to believe.
Ugh I just feel so shit for you and now she's trying to turn it onto you 😠.
11:30 will be ok!
I'll probably just be around, mildy panicking.
Haha never.
Yeah idk you got to be on your toes, can't trust nobody it sucks 😅.
Haha no I'm fine.
It will print out fine dw.
Also can you send Indra some cute dog/cat pics she's not feeling to good atm.
The fashion thing didn't go very well, they didn't print the catalogue.
So all that time and stress for nothing.
Yeah she sent an email to the organiser and she replied sort of being a bit bitchy? Like, "what did you expect to get paid for this?!".
Thank u 💕✨.
Yeah so she's just a bit disheartened abt the industry rn 😕.
Ah yes your famous rifle.
Hey idk if I can make coffee at 11:30, printer troubles.
Heading to impact now so I may not have a chance sorry.
Hopefully!
I should be back at 12:30.
😓.
On the tram back now!
Ahaha ok.
It's not that hard.
You'd still in the Mac lab?
B10.
Lol u vomigg 2day?
Coming.
Can't spell.
Obviously.
hey we are finising up here.
Just in Bowen st!
Just grabbing some don don be there soon.
Oh good! Not too long.
Yeah I am 😢.
Sorry left phone to charge on other side of room.
Yeah I'm just doing the blank book.
Ok whatever you feel like is best 💕 see you lunch time.
Yeah I'm going to head off soon.
Yeah I'm fine, just being too careful so this is taking longer than I thought.
Nope Tristan and Sophia are here! Indra was too until a couple hours ago.
That is also why this took so long.
HAHAHA.
Oh true.
It's ok.
We drive eachother up the wall sometimes haha.
In a nice way.

And text pages came out looking very crisp, shame I can't use them anymore.
It isn't tho.
Oh in different light there is a faint sparkle.
But it is quite dull.
Was expecting that bc of the uncoated paper I guess.

Ah ok. I've heard rumours that they may release another one, or something to replace it in the line up.
Oh that's right.

It's a couple years old already tho, and these phones tend to get quite slow after about 3.5 years.

Hey I'm so sorry.
I had my phone iny pocket I was trying to finish the presentation, that's why I wasnt checking my phone in sorry.
I didn't know you were texting me.
I'm sorry.
I know.
I was trying to finish this project I'm sorry.
I'm on bowne st.
😞 I know, I didn't see you come in.
Like right at the start, then I turned to look at you were chatting W indra.
Yes.
I'm outside b9.
I can be late to class I don't care.
Did you want to talk.
What time does your class gunshot.

Ok I'll make sure to leave then.

He didnt want to rush off.
But you know what he's like.
All steely.
Yes I think he will.
I'm out where are U?
Hey hope ur ok man, if there's anything for other classes you miss I'll pass them on 👍.
Yeah by b9 entrance.
That's ok, I love you anyway hehe.
Yeah I know, I realised afterwards the mistake I had made and how that would have come across to you.
And then I went up to try and find you but it was too late.
So don't apologize.
Yeah I guess so I didn't think it through.
Yeah, but I also didn't want to ditch the group ☹️ so I thought this would be ok.
But it wasn't obv.
Yeah I know I should have just said so 😔.
Hey I just ran into a friend so I'll be back a bit later still.
Yeah no it's ok.
Oh no, well just so you know I won't think you're a burden when you tell me these rhings.
😽.
That's why I want you to open up to me!
Hmm U help by beongy gf!
Being my gf.
💕💕❤️💙.
Loved “Thank you, I used to be afraid to open up to anyone because I thought they would reject me but you have only responded with love and kindness to me and I thank you for that ❤️”.
😽😽😽😽.
Rather u cry onto my shoulder in private but what can you do ☺️✨😘.
No not yet, ran into yoon getting off the bus just grabbing a drink W him now.
Hehe ok ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.
😽.
Hey just finished with Yoon, on the tram rn. ❤️.

Hey!!
What's up 😽.

Good good.
Should I leave you to continue working?
😙.
(or do you not mind me distracting U)
Ahaha ok.
Best not bring the phone in.
Same tho ❤️.
Ok well we can talk when you're out.
😘.
I feel sick just thinking about how I didn't respond to you 😔 I don't really have any excuse/rationalisation for what I did. Kat and Indra both were kind of like, "yeah, guys tend to miss that signal lol". But I feel like you deserve better. I'm always telling you, yeah I can fit you in it'll be fine but I always end up leaving you waiting or only half focused on you.
I want to do better.
So I'm sorry, and I'm going to try and be more realistic with my time from now on. Ie after work.
☺️💕.
To lighten the mood...
So cheeky.
Goodnight, don't stay up too late 😘.
Oh dear, and he I am still in bed haha 😴🛏.

Not the best start to work today:
InDesign on the iMac kept freezing, so biting the bullet and updating.
So forced to use my laptop again.
Lynda in a meeting so don't know what she wants me to do today.
And Tim (big boss who is now prioritising my tasks) is not in today, and hasn't told me what I should be working on.
Haha great start to this new system lol.
😑.
Thank u.
Well it's the whole Adobe suite, so may take all day...
But didn't have a choice.
Can't work when it beach balls whenever I scroll or save.
🙃🙃🙃🙃.
(why does my 7 year old laptop work better than a 4 yr old iMac?)
Also I haven't updated my Mac software in a long time, but HEY APPLE at least it works with Adobe!!!
Afraid to update in case things break and I'll be 💀💀💀💀💀.
(sorry for these software rants, hope ur day goes better than mine)

💕⭐️.
Coming home.
I'll try and get there around midday, although with public holding ptv it may be a struggle.

Oh damn what a pain.
Oh dear, if you'd prefer not to you don't have to go ahaha.

Yep! Asked Adam if he wanted to come I think he's still thinking abt it.
He just asked now did you want to go or not? It's fine if youd rather not!
Hmm Flinders st station.
Then we can catch the train down its only 10-15 mins.
Hmm idm.

Otherwise we could meet Tuesday during the day? A bit convoluted going back and forth tho...

I should be able to come over and stay the night x🐣.

Ah damn, would have been nice to start out strong.
Like an in class demo?
That's good.
Yeah I've had one class that's quite intense, had to bind two books in 4 weeks lol ☠️.
But the other two work on longer timeframes so they aren't very stressful, but it's easier to fall behind.
Yes, unfortunately 😣.

One of the two haha.
It's giving me a bunch of changeovers now, what's the station near county court? It's Flagstaff isn't it?
Looks a bit closer.

Also we're thinking of going out somewhere.
Like a bobo pub or bar or something chill.
Haven't decided yet haha.

😜.
I think it's going to be a quite night anyway haha.

😉.

If the other person is running late.
Creeps.
Bleh.
😖.
Or just me 🐶.
What time is your last bus?

Very jealous.

Lil' goat 💞.

It's ok my bad.
I can cope haha.
Love u too😍.
Ok!
😊.
Just made it onto my tram ❤️.
It's ok don't apologise 😙.
🐹.
Still on the bus? 😕.
Yeah just finished eating ahah got so hungry on the tram.
🤤.
You home to now? 💕.
😊.
Yay! Dinner time?
Oh dear *stomach grumbles*.
Sorry was just going through FB app turning everything off haha took a bit of time.
Ads and stuff.
Apparently a bunch of sites have been uploading my contacts without my permission??? Or they've received them from a third party???
So fb has my contacts even though I've never let them upload to them??
Or these other places do at least.
It's a bit BS.
😠.
Haha nobody does anymore!
No this is standard practice unfortunately...
Read earlier that only 50 Aussies used that app that stole their data, but that meant up to 310,000 others had their data taken without consent.
Well "steal" is perhaps the wrong word, seeing as fb and Google basically lay it out on a silver platter for whomever 😣.
Loved an image.
Very gross.
⚰️🔄.
But this way I get advertising that's relevant to me so that's a fair trade!! 👍👌💯.
Instead of slightly less irrelevant ads which I don't care abt anyway!
Faustian pact more like 😈🤝👨(<- Zucc)
Yeah hold on let me head to the spare room for some privacy.
Yup!
😙.

Indra is sick too, was alerted over Snapchat 😷.
Mum is happy to do the bag, just let me know the dimensions roughly.
We've got heaps of muslin.
Prob can't do a drawstring but she can make a fold over pouch thing very easily.
💜🐻.
😕💀.
Oh good! Anything to help that dreaded bus ride.
Haha nice.
Is that important?
Do they have to be pyramid?
True, I suppose...
Does it have to be 20?
Doh.
Find smaller pyramids?
Or round ones?
Hmm.
Not sure 😕 was thinking like ur Robert Timms coffee.
Hmm I must have seen circle ones elsewhere then...
Loose leaf not a gogo?
Those sachets look nice, but a lot of work?
Small pyramids maybe?
Had a look at our collection, mostly loose leaf.
But a Tetley one had small ish sized bags, another had larger than usuall flat ones with no tag.
Hmm that's a shame...
May have to go shopping tomorrow morning?
You'll find a solution don't worry 💖😊.
Aww I love you too 😚. Also would you like to come over Saturday during the day? Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time.
^ me + trumppy.
this is too much fun lo.
not sure if i like it a bit more cogent with fuller sentences, or a bit more gibberish, more spliced together. hmm.
same, but it thought emojis were nouns for some reason, so i lost all of them 😑.
I could just do a find/replace of names for obscurity?
but if i turn this into something else it may not matter, since the underlying data may not be shown.
I’m just spamming tristan all my favourite ones haha he’s going to get a surprise when he opens his phone.
😚.
how’s that for a come-on?! 😂.
this is my greatest work.
have fun!
may publish this as a book for capstone.
￼￼Folds over and inside to close.
Don't think this'll hold 20 tea bags tho 😓.
I'll bring it tomorrow you can check, otherwise we can make another one 💜.
Goodnight💖.
Does your InDesign support emojis?
Good morning sweet! 😘.
Ty.
Asking the real qs.
Haha no not me! The intern likes to tho.
No in my version if I paste one in it comes out as random characters.
Nah on like her FB meme poste.
Yeah I remember seeing it on my work comp. Wasn't sure if it was Id or Ps.
I know Adobe only added colour font support last year tho, which is why mine doesn't work.
Yeah!
Check it out it's rather sweet. Before that each OS had their own incompatible way of showing a "colour" font (png for apple, svg for Google, etc).
So now it's standardised.
All g, thanks!
Some circus performers are throwing those sticks around in the middle of the road, when the lights are red 😡😁.
Hey our class had finished for the day, going to hang around tho.
6a!
did you want to come up?
xx.
Hey mum Ella's got her tea box here:.
Would it be easy enough to make a square bottomed bag? Or would that be too difficult?
Prob doesn't need a top? Like can be open at the top.
Not sure, she just used a template online.
thank you!
Got ur charger let me in!
😠rude oldies.
😊😘.
Sure did!
Coming home now.
Defective tram ahead - not going anywhere anytime soon.
Broken down tram ahead of us, stuck at Elgin St for an indefinite time😡🐻😅.
Elgin St/Lygon st.
Have barely left the city!
Ok he's going to go down Sydney Rd instead now.
He just told us he's going to go down Sydney Rd instead 💖.
Oh man good thing we left when we did, this is going to cause so many problems when peak hour hits.
😘.
And good thing we had a snack 😊.
Ah lucky! A smooth bus ride for once.
A first!
Oh wait so he just kicked us off he's not taking us then.
Actually he's not.
Will walk back to city and switch.
Hey dad tram fault along Lygon st, would I be able to leave with you?
Just checking if dad has left, will leave with him.
Otherwise I'm going back into the city anyway so can take the Sydney Rd myself.
Got kicked off at Melb uni so am coming back into city, can get to your work in 10.
Haha true.
Alone TU.
Tho.
Thank you!
Ok going home with dad.
Going home W dad.
🙌.
So proud!!
Yay!
Remember not too many options this time 💜.
No worries, sure will!!
Finally home! 🐻.
￼Version 0.5! (Half size).
So gross 😁.
No idea what that was from, perhaps either u or tristan.
Haha.
Kat actually!
No I said it to her!
She said she popped a pimple just before she left and was thus running late.
😊.
Yay!!
At least it's over now.
I've compiled a little list I'll share it with you 😘.
Hmm I think I can manage this one time 😉.
Also how do you want the top of the bag made up?
Did you want to attach a string or tag to it?? what.
Ok! So just open then, maybe a bit taller so there's a bit of a neck.
Ahaha.
Do you want the frayed edge on the top or would you prefer it finished?
Like hemmed.
Oh haha yes.
Yeah no prob.
Take a look ⬆️.
What are you in the mood for?
￼Came out a bit too narrow.
Just 1?
👌.
From 5 I think?
But I'll prob go later, bc I'll need to eat something.
Ighhhh I don't know hahahahahah.
Art party is 5-9.
So can go later.
What time will I be in the city? Bc I'll be finishing at 5 like allwsy.
Oh sorry, I didn't explain. It's for the students.
Oh ok.
Up to you if you want to wait around until 5 tho 🐸✨💜.
Hmm true, a bit of a waste...
What are you doing in the city?
Ahahah.
Left it a bit late ?? 😜.
Do you have anything to occupy your time  for 3 hours?
Don't want you to wait around a.
Aimlessly.
Hmmm.
Could you meet someone on short notice hahah.
?
Sophia?
Could you have a cute coffee date w her? That'll kill an hour or so?
Wait.
The art party isn't this week.
Why did I think that???
There's something else on I think tho??? I remember making a mental note.
CAnt seem to find anything, must have had a mental fart.
Sorry abt all that.
😅😓.
ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ.
Yeah!
Please do! We can prob get a quick coffee date at pool house or something.
Squeeze it in 💜.
༼ つ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽つ.

Up to u!
Google keyboard.
Prob means that everything I type is being beamed into their servers, but a good trade off??

Oh no!! 😓😓.
Going to bed, goodnight💖.
Loved an image.
Got a couple nice cards for Ella.
Lmk when you want your bag 💖.
Ahh gingerboy isnt free till 9pm on Saturday.

Annam looked nice.
It's sort of Vietnamese.
South East Asian.
Sort of thing.

Done 😘✨.
You're welcome.
Sophia just called me to say "hey Elly is here to take photos of me and my team are you able to come" and I was like... Uggghh nooo not really 😅.
No can't really spare the time.
She said "oh it'll take 10 mins" but it won't take 10 mins.
I saw some fried chicken?
Wut??
Oh dear.
Yeah that's ok.
I'll cancel the booking.
Didn't scroll down enough evidently haha.
There's always Rumi.
Not far from the city so my parents could drive you home too!
I mean not far from either my place and the coty.
Ok there's a 6.30 at Rumi, I'll take it?
Saturday 21 , 6:30.
That's right yeah?
Perfect, all.done!
You'll like Rumi, they'd do vegetarian options too.
I don't think the whole menu is online tho.
Ahah.
Rumi was my first idea should have stuck with it 💖.
You're welcome, any excuse to spoil you and eat out 💜🐻.
Nooo that's ok!! Idm!
I've been paid recently.
Ok cancelled the other gross place.
"we'll see u another time" Yeah right lol!
Such nice looking pictures for a place that serves elephant ears.
I guess it's a Cambodian speciality.
But poor elephants!!
Just forwarded u the booking details.
Mmm can't wait!!
It's prob one of my favourite places.
💜✨.
Coming home now.
Oh!
Was going to once I got ready but forgot.

Tram driver really getting into narrating the tourist stops 😄.
All good, we had the pasta sausage rolls and curry.
Yay!! Glad.
Send a pic? 💜.
Oh looks so good! ✨.
Hey what time is the picnic on Saturday?
Just trying to figure out my game plan...
No just trying to work out how I'm going to carry everything to your place 😅.
I'm thinking I might come home first tomorrow night, then my dad can drop me off at yours after peak hour has subsided.
Otherwise I've got to carry everything on the bus with me... Might squash all your presents...
I'll still be able to stay the night, I'll just get to your place around 7:30/8:00.
Instead of... 7:30/8:00 (due to all the traffic!! 😄).
Dinner will prob be ready when I get home, so not really an issue.
Yeah that's ok!
What time does your mum go to pick up gemma? My dad says she drives past us anyway HAHAHA jkjk.
😘.
My dad can drop you off after our dinner on Saturday.
Otherwise you could come back here Saturday after dinner and we can take you back.
It's just if she is taking us to the restaurant, then she's either got to idle around for two hours or go home and back.
Oh ok.
!
No that's better.
There's a few gelati and Italian pastry places!
🍰😧🔫👩.
Ok so I'll come home after work then get dropped off at your place then. We can figure out the rest afterwards 😘💜✨.
🐻🎈.
good night ❤️ see u tomorrow.

White balance picker doesn't help?
Next to white balance there's usually an icon of an eye dropper?
Click on something white/grey.
Or you can set the white balance manually by taking a photo of something middle grey.

Family all home now... 😓🔊.
Can't escape them!
That's ok 😊.

Don't think I'll leave tomorrow night tho... I should do some more work 😕.
🐶❤️.
I'll come over early instead.
Hope so!!
Goodnight❣️.
Haha felt like I had lost my train of thought after all those arty ones so was kinda frantic.
But I think I got the point across lol.
Hello sorry just finished presenting.
Here all fay.
Will go for lunch in abt 15 ?
Oh ok.
I'll see what happens.

That's ok I should still be on break at 12:30 ☺️.
That's ok ✨.
Finishing now! I've got until 1 ❤️.
Oh I had a coffee this morning already since I arrived early for once... Are you up for going to the new place afterwards tho?
I'll just get a tea with you otherwise ❤️.
At little rigue.
That's ok I'll go collect my prints so I'll be around.
Left today with your jacket and a jumper, mum said as left "it's going to be 25!".
It is not 25.
It should warm up after lunch.
😉.
No, unfortunately 😆.
🚌💨💥🚙🚙.
Finished lunch but may get a little snack 😙.
Ok!
On my way down, you off the bus?
Be there in 2 secs.
Got the thickest one... $12! 😓😳.

Disliked an image.
At least you came in? Made the effort.
Haha who's camrta.
Oohh nice.
Haha u and ella.
Fuck ahahah.
That's what kind of drunk U are.
Was going to get the primary colours but 1 is enough! (+_+).
That's ok should be nice.
It's hard being an elitist, being above the laws of Grammer and spelling.
It's owned by Mitsubishi???!
Taking one for the team.
Hey we're sort of done I'll just be prototypong till 3 (ᵔᴥᵔ).
Rita.js 👌✨.
Haha go ahead steal it anyway.
Almost done too!
Just in 6a.
Oohh ahaha that's ok.
Yeah that's all a bit shit, since we make it up!! Like? Not useful?!? At all!!
Wut.
Still don't know what you're doing btw.
"woke" advertising?
Hmm.
You could make it for something worthwhile I guess? Like an actual issue.
Lucked out man, so upset for you 😠.
On tram now.
Did you get a seat on the bus? ❤️.
Yeah.
Home now, so exhausted😓.
Funny how sitting tires you out.
Ohhh so slow!!
😳.
Not good 😕.
Oohh yum!
I'm going to drive tomorrow ❤️ with dad ofc.
We might leave here around 11? So get to yours at 11:40:45.
Oh yes! Thanks for reminding me.
Can't seem to find the instruction sheet but I'll print off another one.
spinning kitty.
Oh jeez, impressive!
*blush*.
love you too 😉.
🐱.
are you willing?
haha.
🐶.
Good night, see you tomorrow honey 😙☺️.
Loved an image.
Yes! Perfect!! 😊😆.
Haha ok!
Leaving now.
Here!
Yeah all good here, Ella's parents said one of them are happy to drop me off.
I did don't worry 😅.
Coming home now.
❤️❤️❤️.
Oh sorry must have missed this the first time around 😣.
Hmm I was excited at first but she's only the support?
But like I'm still excited.
Ohh.
Hmm re-interested again.
I haven't heard any of Alice glass's solo stuff, but would imagine it suits Zola 😅.
I quite liked the latest album, a return back to her old sound and good cover art.
Yeah, not as amazing as conatus but still satisfying.
Yeah Ill be down, I need to check the dates tho.
Hmm still a bit peckish, the one time I was ready for desert and I'm not there 😔.
☺️😉.
Rest of family will have their tea in about half an hour.
🙌🙌🙌.
🙀.
Soo good!! And a quick reply ❤️.
Also mum says you're welcome to stay both nights if you need ☺️.
That's ok, it will be fine.
Actually mum says she not sure if those other friends are going... So we may just have each other to talk to haha 😉.
And Stephen.
No these people aren't at all like Daniel.
Oh yeah, I think so?
What time is it?
Yeah that's fine.
😂.
Yes that's my next project now 😘.
Ahhha hmm.
You asking for tips haha?
Hmm.
She's not going to expect anything too big, she doesn't want to make a big fuss 😅.
If you can find anything Moomin related that'll be a plus?
Yeah she's got a couple won't say no to another one.
Ahhaha idk how she'd feel about a massive one but maybe??
Like what you got kat yeah.
She'd prob be in love with it tbh 🐻.
Gonna go to bed, done most of the mobile site and the style guide 😘.
Thanks for inviting me today I had a sweet time ☺️.
Yeah truw.
Haha just started today lol dw 🙀.
But got work tomorrow so had to get it out of the way ☹️.
Almost done bleh I just made it look like a dribble site so generic.
Can confirm all those things.
Oh shit yeah that sheet , got to do mine tomorrow fuckk.
Illustrator! HAH.
tried downloading sketch but I'm running an older mac os so none of the fancy prototype apps were supported 😣.
I think it's Yosemite or something?? Like not that old idk why theyre so quick to drop support.
For the final.
It's supposed to be a bit nicer than just illustrator or Photoshop, more suited to app designs and stuff I think?
Wireframes I'm just gonna sketch by hand.
True just apple has had a bad run with glitchy updates the past few times so kinda hesitant.
Adobe has their clone too (Xd) I tried the beta last year but it was pretty limited.
That is also true.
That's ok my pleasure!
It's a lot of fun ❤️.
Fuck they're so bad.
Like you'd think they're new software would be faster bc it doesn't have 20 yrs of cruft bit apparently not??
Yeah, that and the fact that they have the industry wrapped around their finger.
Well the print industry.
Gonna switch to GIMP.
Haha yeah I remember I used to use it too, before I figured out how to pirate Photoshop ofc.
Wait wut.
Who did this???
Huh???
And there's a YouTube link to Macintosh plus??
Maybe they tag teamed to prank us all??
It's been dying a long slow painful death.
Ok so here's the goss.
People kept complaining to Sophia abt the old cover photo so she said give me a new one.
And Vinny made this one so she just uploaded it.
And apparently Andy's picture is in the background.
Yeah but kind of an eyesore.
At least we didn't go Memphis?
Ahaha same.
Tron Andy maybe.
Would not have batted an eyelid if you kept gal tbh.
Haven't listened in a while but damn thanks for reminding me.
Soundtrack to me rushing to complete this project.
Also hush hush, but Andy may be taking capstone.
He's not sure, but the higher ups were disappointed last year so they want to change it up.
No clue how it works.
Yeah it'll either be fantastic or a complete mess it only goes two ways.
That's why it's called.
Mess is more.
Enjoy the ice cream !
Fire alarm first thing in the morning!
Yeah.
Left all my stuff hopefully not anything.
I've followed the team into a bike shop...
Yay!
Ahaha am a bit tempted by the cute fixed gear ones 😙.
Oh dear...
Back in the office, nothing burnt.
Oh good idea!
Hey just finished work where's this thing?
See you soon! 🐻.
Heyo can you let me in?
Nvm done random let me in.
Some random.
Hey 😘.
Just finished at work, at some activator thing with Sophia atm ✨.
Some startup thing, a bit boring.
Yay! Can I see a pic?!
Loved an image.
Looks great!!
Oh of course, so the light doesn't reflect 👌.
Bit of a waste of time that thing was... Just crackers to eat and no drinks! 😠😆.
Yeah going home now.
Probably some nice leftover curry Orr something ❤️🐻.
Ahaha had that today for lunch 😊.
Sophia was stressing about her code website.
Done the laptop but n or needs the mobile styles.
(I know 😜).
Oh jeez./ what flavour.
Not even edible! 😆.
HAHA 😙.
Hmm not good 😣 nap time?
Aww honey.
Made yourself sick 💥.
Make sure you eat some actual food tho, tonight. Even if you did feel 😙.
Ill.

All this s stopping and starting on the tram is marketing me a bit ill too...
Got a seat now thankfully.
Almost home.
All good idm.
It's not raining is it?
Oh well oj.
Ok.
At Crozier st?
Actually it's fine just got off.
Barly spitting.
Home finely.
When it says "submit prototype" does that just mean the working file?
Like in my case the illustrator file?
Hmm not sure.
I think he says screenshots and prototype.
Wait having a look now, doesn't mention them on deliverables.
Tristan confused me lol.
I just stretched and my parents were all like "what what's the matter" 😆.
Haha.
Arggf finally done the mobile site I think it looks ok now.
Now to record the video 😅.
Ahaha that's ok! 😙.
So sleep y.
￼Just saw this again! ❤️☺️.
Oh sorry! Was recording my videos.
I'll check with mum.
But what did you decide on?
Nah just me and Stephen.
It's his friends I think.
Or just the young-uns at least aha.
No I don't see why it would 😊.
Ahaha I'm asking you that sounds like a yes doesn't it 😉😘.
(if I didn't I wouldn't have asked in the first place 😅).
We won't stay for very long.
Ahah yeah that's just my bad timming, tbh I didn't feel much like going...
So I'd prefer it if you came! ❤️.
To talk with me 😩.
😘.
Oh true...
Well we have shampoo and hairdryers and straiteners!
Might need more than your tote haha.
Your free to use our soaps etc, maybe not make-up bc it's a bit more specific...
Not at all ❤️ you won't be 😘 and we'll be out most of the day anyway.
Ahah and yours to me.
Yeah she said so last night 😉.
Do you have an overnight bag or something, a camping bag?
We are happy to drive you home on Sunday.
Perfect!
(I can drive ☺️).
Get those hours up!
I still have to pass the test tho!!
Ahhh haven't decided yet 😅.
More pressing things 😬.
Mmm just smart casual?
You know how I dress.
A shirt perhaps.

Failed once already.
Will send a Dropbox link otherwise!
Hopefully that will upload too ahahahaahaha.

So I have all the time in the world now ❤️.
Ok going to get ready, goodnight.
Goodnight my 💗.
Morning 🐱.
Did you want to meet me in the city after work and we can head home together? 😙.

Hmm not even sure when the thing is lemme check.
What time should Ella arrive tonight? Her mum is going to drop her off.
Nah he didn't.
Ahaha ahhh sorry 😓.
No I don't unfortunately...
Don't think my mum know either.
But if I leave at 5 I should be back by 5:45/6.
So come around at 6?
We don't want to get there too early anyway ahah 😘.
I'll tell her to come past at 6 then?
Hmm yeah don't worry I'll just pop past before I leave 😙.
Less mucking around.
Just send me whichever one you neee.
Ok! ❤️.
Ill get it on my afternoon walk.
Oh wait, we have a photographer here maybe I could ask her what she recommends?
That's cheaper but good?
Do you want glossy or matte or satin?
Didn't think so haha.
Whattt.
Just asked she said illford.
She had a quick look at an online store in Brunswick, matte 25 sheets A6 sized is $15.
Satin is $25.
Sorry in Collingwood.
But I imagine Michaels has the same in store.
Perhaps online is for bulk.
😘.

It's dawn press the one that comes up first on Google... Thought it was a proper print place 😅.
Yeah but he's doing it part time now it seems. He's studying now ahaha.
So I felt bad 😣.
He prob doesn't make much printing affordable riso prints for unemployed artists ☹️.
Hmm we need a nice cute Riso centre like this one:.
코우너스 Corners (@cornersinfo) • Instagram photos and videos.
Thats ok! Just got home!
Need a bit of a lie down anyway 🐱.

Ahaha that's good then, Liam said he was looking forward to "sinking a beer with your dad" 😅.
About to do the speeches... How far are you.

Ah ok, were just about to go back.
See you.
About to head off we'll see you tonight maybe.

All done!
Mostly talked about the venue.
I think everyone is warming to holding it at rmit.
And save that 3000.
Andy will be taking capstone too.
We also spoke about how we want to organise the show, what we wanted to get out of it.
Yeah!
Just on Bowen st.
Aww.

Same!
Yeah!
Ok cool just waiting around uni. See you at 6.30.
Ah ok on my way down.
About to cross the road where are you?
Yeah don't think you'll enjoy wild at heart...
Forgot there was not one but two 50s ballads sung by Nic cage.
Yes it was a good time 😅.
And a very uncomfortable one.
As usual.
That's a fact.
Daniel's going to cover back with me again his mum will pick him up.
Ahhhh finely home.
Ahah that's ok 😙.
I forgot about this movie bit Daniel reminded me lol.
He truly has.
Perhaps his strangest one.
Bc it is so unlike him.
Oh, what for? ☹️.
Aww Honey...
That's why I am here.
To cut you up!
Cheer.
Not cut 😅.
You can do plenty of things!!!
What do you mean 😣.
Yeah but that doesn't mean you won't do anything.
You can overcome anxiety.
Ohhhhhh baby you're definitely not! 💗.
Did you go driving, is that what this is about?
Hmm why is she so cruel to you.
Well, I think you're amazing.
Good.
☹️.
That's ok you didn't have to apologize.
I just want to make u feel better.
Please do, you need it.
(fuck you just reminded me of all the Tumblrs I need to do 😬☠️).
I'm going to go to sleep too tho.
Do you still feel upset? 🐶.
Hmm ok.
Oh no it's he ok?
A bit sick?
Ahah.
Itchy boy.
Ok I'll let you get your rest, goodnight my love 💗🐱☺️.
😙.
Hope so! I have a feeling he'll finish up early.
So I should be about to come back before your done.
☺️.
See you.
Morning 😊.
Laughed at “Ok that must have been a late one - on my way now ”.
We're all running late to class it seems😅.
People in my class haven't gotten their results for Blair from 5 weeks ago either.
Nah still walking to it lol.
😙.
Presentation went well - librarian was really excited! Everyone was like yeah I got a spare bike we can use, so I was like oh ok this is actually happening 😮.
Going to stay here for lunch and the afternoon, I'll let you know when we finish.
Also Karen and Andy are apparently card carrying members of the Italian communist party????
Couldn't tell if he was joking but he said he needed something from them and they made a deal if he could get three signups??
Like chairs or something.
It was very strange.
Also not surprised.
Hey going to come back now.
Yes!
Will take 15 mins to get back to Collins St, then I'll catch a tram up.
Just waiting on swanston for a tram, want to get a coffee and a sweet?
Outside rmit stop?
😙☺️.
So long!
Watching that abstract doco on Netflix, the first one is very good 👌.
The documentary?
It's some series on a bunch of designers in various fields.
Paula scher has an ep 😊.
But watching this one about a German illustrator rn.
Hello 😗.
No just procrastinating.
😄.
Oh this AHAHA.
Ordering one now.
I know 🐐.
No alpaca emoji ☹️.
Good work around.
Feeling a bit less weary now?
Haha same same ❤️.
Gonna go to sleep soon tho.
Didn't do anything, just watched more coding vids of that crazy guy.
😊🐶.
I think you need the most rest out of all of us - hope no one keeps you awake again 😣.
Yeah! See you then❤️.
😗😗😗.
Good morning 🐣.
Oh! How come?
Hmm.
Puzzling.
... so you won't be coming in then huh.
So much effort tho to get into the city?
Ah, good ☺️😄.
Indra's got her com wallet out - she knows 😉.
How does forager sound?
Or foliage?
No that just makes it sound like they threw some damp leaves in a bag.
❤️.
Next store is watching that ted talk, everyone looks dead.
Donnneeee.
Yeah.
That's ok I'll bum around.
Nah supposed to finish at 4.
Yeah.
Yeah I can come dowb.
!!
Ok! Was walking down with kat and Indra but then they detoured into the bath room ahaha.
Good idea 👌.
Crossing the road!
Yeah just doing done errands with Ella atm, will leave soon.
Sooo wobbly 😮😭.
Yay! Me too! ❤️.
Can't wait!!
Had a rather productive shower! I think I have something for my data vis project now!
Going to go with your fanfiction / rom com script idea.
I'll probably have to feed some of that data in and mix it with me and trumpy.
And then basically I want to have one display that would generate the scenes/lines. I could use the receipt printer for this, but I was also thinking my kindle could work?
And then on another screen/projection I have a picture of me and trump either side. Maybe I'll switch emotions based on the emotion of the scene.
And then use the keywords of the scene to just layer search images to illustrate the scene.
Thank you for the idea 😊.
Now I need to figure out how to actually do it...
😆.
Aha awww you didn't have to do all this! Thank you so much though!!! 😊😊😊.
It all looks very cool I'll have a look later on 💗.
Yeah its a pretty common practice that's why I was so stuck for a while 😄.
Get some sleep 😣.
Hey dad, happy birthday today! I'll see you later tonight.
Riso's came in!!! 😮☺️☺️.
Yeah that's should be good.
Just at the printers trying to sort some thing out...
So hard to print a few a3 posters 😆.
They have some new system... Looks like it causes more problems than it solves.
Ahah yeah...
Sorted it out.
Eventually.
But don't know why it didn't work.
Ywahhh.
Haha hope he likes Japanese food!
Sounds good.
Yeah that's alright ❤️.
That's ok!
See if you can add your ticket.
Prob won't need it but just in case.
👌💗😊.
Going to a Japanese restaurant on Sunday for dads birthday, dunno how he'll feel about that 😄.
Ahaha!
Go sort them out 😉.
It didn't feel that warm when I went outside.
Nah.
Hmm who knows what it will be like... Bring a jacket just in case tho! 😊.
Damn.
Me too.
And my shoes.
Going to get wrecked.
Good idea.
Not sure when I'll finish, the thing starts around 5.
Does Daiso have a card minimum?
About to head down now, where are you?
Oh dear.
Just walked out now meet you halfway?
Along swanston St.
❤️.
At state lib.
Ofc.
... playing Rick Astley at ABC ... 😐.
Haha yes😙.
Just waiting on the tram sorry, will be home soon.
Oh ok, good.
Yeah we went for dinner after the gallery.
Hmm always a drama.
😮.
☹️.
Still waiting for my tram ...
🙌.
Tram finally here.
Finally on the tram.
I know 😞.
🙏.
Damn.
Could have missed it.
What happened.
?
Oh.
Haha.
Thought something was wrong.
😊.
Doesn't seem to be Reading here.
Hope so!
One cloud making its way across.
Hopefully it goes out east instead of North.
Yeah 🌿.
Ahaha last few stops the tram people hopped on and um I guess I forgot to update my concession card?
Woops.
He says if they send you I fine and I've gotten a new one in the interim I can appeal.
He took my detsls.
Lol.
They were very polite about tho.
Hey mum are you able to pick me up it's starting to rain.
I'm on Harding st.
Damn.
Also now it's raining.
It was a good night...
Now... Not so much.
Ahaha thanjs.
By the flower shop.
😐.
Home now got picked up.
That's ok - you did warn me all those months ago about this 😄.
The parts with you were very good.
I know 😭.
So gone.
Postgrad 😉.
Haha yeah, prob even more chill.
Sorry missed it before bc I was being hassled,  happy to meet after idm. I've got pizza for lunch ahaha.
Or we could just meet up and eat together for lunch, idm!

😙.
Same same 🐶.
😴💕.
Sogni d'oro.
Marie called as I was about to leave, I said you were doing some stuff for Serge so she'll call back later.
I'll have a look when I get to the office.
What's the difference between soy and bonsoy?
Coffee shop lists options for both.
Hmm.
Aside from price.
Hajj.
🐶😉.
Omg apparently last night the check in folk made Lynda sign up on event Brite to get in 😆😆😆.
He didn't know who she was 😭.
Haha I know right.
Soy tastes quite sweet, do you find that?
Dunno if it makes any difference to my stomach lol.
Could also just be the effects from the past 24 hours, since I woke up feeling funny...
What.
Huh.
No.
But pleae.
Enlighten me.
What a name.
Was David his drummer.
He split with one of the other members to start making folk/ambient music.
According to a death metal site.
HAHAH.
Such range.
"cerulean transience of all my imagined shores".
Going to listen to this as I design rmit graphics.
Can you please thank Taylor for this discovery, much appreciated.
His last name means hen in Italian btw.
Gallina.
HAHA.
He sounds like a little gremlin.
Yeah fine now I think.
😊xx.
Nah don't think I can make it sorry, got too much stuff on unfortunately.
Oh crap same here.
told me 25 and sunny.
But I'm cold in the office.
Haha.
😙❤️.
Thank u ✨.
Oh wow 😅.
With pinhole?
😭.
Yeah that should be fine.
Same here hopefully!
Almost done, just got to tidy up ❤️.
Heading out now!
Yeah, but I'll be back a bit later.
✨💕.
Two NZ tourists were on the tram slamming VB under the "no opened alcohol" sign 😆😐.
Was worried he was going to lose balance and get beer all over me.
😅.
Yeah just left.
😉.
Yeah still in Brunswick.
Ok.
Home yet?
Yes 😆💕.
Finally!!
Going to leave around 11:45? Takes about 35 mins.

An hour before? 12:30?
Oh good, that's a relief!

Assure you mine is even less cozy... ☹️.
Wearing that new shirt 💕.
No Ramen it seems, but other delicious things!
Thank u!
Only been awake for 8 hours today lol but already tired 😆.
Nah about to leave now 😊.

When I come across them, i send them.
So round 🐶.
Ahah a little farm.

Ah, thank you!

Sorry might be running late - need to finish lunch!
Damn 😓.

That's ok ❤️ go give your dad some company 😆.
I really liked it too.
On my way.
Oh no! 😓😭.
Yeah therer were quite a few in a row so got a quiet one.
Nah not yet.
Haven't eaten yet.
Will it still be peak hour for u?
Ah good.
😣.
On 1% so don't dear if I cut out.
Hope not!
Home now!
A long ride ahead 😞.

Yay!! finally you.

Morning 😄.
Haha same😞.
I was going to go Wednesday night at Harding st.
?
Ok then.
Ok.
Yeah sure, what time ?
Ah.
Not sure.
We're building a cardboard bike atm 😞.
Yeah I did ❤️.
Ok!
About to leave now, Andy has left us but we're going to leave.
😉.
That's ok I can apparently go until 5.20.
Almost finished.
Idk I hope so.
That's just what mum said.
Done now.
On my way home. I got it.
Ahh ok.
That's ok.
HAHA.
dunno, he could be a Seinfeld fan?
Yes yes.
George would be a one to calm you down.
Not bad.
I think he would appreciate it for its umusualness...
But he'll prob push you to make something luxury...
Bc that's his sort of style I guess.
Like no but I feel like he's the kind of guy that would "encourage" you to do that.
I agree.
Everyone's will end up looking the same.
Yeah idk come in with some backing and see what he says.
There's no target Market set so you can do whatever you want there I guess.
Oh no! ❤️.
Lunch I felt a bit weird bc of my stomach.
Sorry I must have gotten the messages while I was at the pharmacy, or on my way.
They had trouble finding my appointment 🙄.
Hmm true.
O don't know why I didn't see it.
Sorry I wasn't trying to defend him, I meet him one for 30 secs.
I mean I don't trust him either.
I just meant to say that I couldn't really judge him as a bad person bc I don't know his reasons.
Possibly he had shitty reasons, in which case yes he's sitting then.
I'm sorry, I wasn't! 😄😓.
Not grumpy.
I can bring the paper tomorrow, if tag along but I prob won't have time before my haircut.
Sorry ☹️.
I'll see how early we finish class, I might be able to make it.
Good, they'll just tire you out anyway 😉.
Can I give you the paper before hand then?
Then catch up afterwards?
Yeah up to ypu.
Got a lollipop from the flu guy 🍭.
But I can't get it out of the packet 😂.
Mostly.
Haven't gotten the flu yet, so hard to tell if it's a waste of money or its working😉.
Some people are really against it for some reason.
They prob think it's a scam lol 😆.
😽.
Well theres multiple flu strains so they pick and choose which ones they think will be the most common that year.
Don't know how long the shot lasts tho.
💖.
You get home ok? Good idea to miss the rush hour.
😣.
So early!!
Why so many people ditching work early 😄.
Grrr transdev 🤜🤜.
Haha.
Almost like a train would help sort out this mess.
Some people in class were complaining about their tram woes... They don't know how good they have it!
"oh yeah sometimes it's just faster to walk" 😆.
Us coddled inner city-slickers! 😄.
One day we'll rent a little place with convenient public transport options my love 💖.
Perhaps even a bike path nearby? 🙀.
Ahaha never 😜.
Aww he's got his own little floaties.
It would be even cuter if he had the ones that go around his arms 🐶.
Hehe.
Good 😍.
Sorry for upsetting you earlier.
😓.
Feel bad tho.
Thank you, it's fine now❤️.
But my life will be worse off now without coffee... At least for the rest of this week.
I think I'll stop this week - then see how it makes me feel next week.
Hopefully my stomach just needs some time to relax.
Please, don't join in my suffering... I can get matcha lattes instead.
I guess? But also Coles is every where and stocks all sorts of shit.
They may have some fancy stuff in say toorak.
Idk.
Yeah I mean he showed us a few luxury tea brands and Coles def won't sell them.
I mean the point of this class is to make something slick for your portfolio, most people will do something fancy bc it looks cool, and that sort of design ends up being higher end bc it costs more...
So it could just be that effect.
As opposed to him dictating the style.
Yeah but at the end of the day what matters is what looks good in your folio, just saying.
Different if there were more restrictions.
But he seemed to be talking about "the shelf".
More just to think about how to catch people eye, not to make something that fits a Coles demographic.
I mean theres all sorts of packaging styles at coles.
Prob not gold foil but still.
Sorry lol the point of this is do the Seinfeld thing and fuck Renato.
😜.
So then design to your style, or to what will make your work look good.
I guess I'm saying "luxury" but I mean more "nicer than teatley".
Thank you 😘.
In renato's class does he try to push you towards more luxury style?
Or does he try and push his style instead of to ur own?
Ah just checked with Ella and he said that he doesn't push his own style in class so we may be bitching for no reason.
He just wants some "contemporary".
But 80s/90s revival should be ok bc you're doing it in a modern way, not actually just making a tea packet that looks straight out of the 80s.
Ahh I see.
Speaking to Sophia she wanted to do one thing but it wasn't necessarily "minimal luxury style" so we were complaining a bit.
She was going on how "actually it says it will be in Coles so you can't do luxury" and I was like, I don't think anyone cares tbh 😜.
It's for people to make something for their portfolio, expensive shit looks cool.
See you!
At the end of the day that's all that matters.
Ella has a good point, just make what will look good in your portfolio. If he has a problem with it there's lots of crits in class you'll def hear about it 😄.
Came across this YouTube the other day, all this info about the new CSS specs.
Flex box and grid - so much stuff!!
You can use characters (width of 0 character) as units now! 😱.
True unfortunately.
We are all Elaine.
Shoes are still too small once the inersoles are in...
🙃.
They would... But they aren't that great.
I need these shoes to not fuck up my feet bc I'll probably wear them often.
I'll have to return them.
It's going to rain all week 😣.
Probably, but I feel like my shoes would still get ruined.
Bc they're sort of rough and fuzzy?
No no other shoes really.
Mum really doesn't like the supergas it seems.
"your foot will get cold!".
Questioned “What about those crocodile lacrosse shoes? ”.
?
What are they?
Ohhhh.
Sorry.
Nah not really, too preppy.
Mum made a point of the inersoles being quite thick, I'll have to look for some other ones...
Problem is each chemist only sells one 😭 so have to go on a mission.
Mum says the shoes will probably get ruined in the rain too.
Which is why my last pair broke apart so quickly I guess.
Mine tore at the tip remember.
Fuck now I'm all anxious and annoyed.
Need to go and make 6 logos by tomorrow too.
Nah man definitely not going to have time... Sorry.
Getting really busy with all this uni shit.
Fuck.
Ella just hug me please!!!
Ahaha maybe for inspiration.
The ones you didn't show renator.
Laughed at “No joke this is how long it takes to fully dry my hair ”.
That's ok I'm just throwing whatever onto the page atm.
It's all shot.
Oh yeah have to put in herbal infusion.
ESP with a lowercase g.
Can't run it underneath bc the g gets in the way 😭.
Klim type has trial fonts of all their stuff, pretty neat 👌.
Yeah.
Haha.
Ok.
I probably have enough but don't really like most of them.
That damned herbal infusion!!!
😄.
Hopefully! I'll see how I go but we should be able to meet for at least half an hour.
Ah that's ok.
Depends on how long our class takes...
Ahaha all g Can relate.
5:45.
That's ok ❤️.
Nah Brunswick.
About 20 mins from the cbd?
No! I don't mind the company 😽.
I just feel bad taking up your afternoon now.
Ok! ❤️ Thank u.
Yeah I can show you!
Ahaha look at you being organised.
It's almost as if going to class is actually less productive 🤔.
You can buy a stack.
Hmm I think i got 60 pages for about $35?
Nope!
Yeah!
Haha so cute ❤️.
Good night...
Just got to find one more....
Ahaha already done that  😉.
It's fine just picked a reject.
Sleep tight.
Grimes is dating Elon Musk what timeline is this.
Those inersoles for perfectly in my white converse, which are about a size too big anyway. So not all is lost 😽.
*inersoles we got.
￼😱.
Sorry might be a bit late.
Don't know what is going on.
I'll see if mum can drive me to Sydney Rd.
Probably 😣.
Fuck I forgot the paper samples.
It was stephen cream vellum.
Or Strathmore cream vellum.
If you ask them for cream vellum paper they'll point it out to you you can see which ones you like.
Sorry.
Fuck.
Failed my boyfriend duties.
😓.
Sorry I'm just anxious.
Waiting on the tram now won't be long hopefully we can grab something to go.
Ok ...
Yeah... Don't have an a3 printer.
On the tram now, scheduled to arrive at mc Elizabeth St at 12:40.
If you're there early maybe get two to take away we can sit and have them in b9?
Thank u 😽.
Hmm something black maybe? Like not a herbal.
Or maybe a herbal actually.
To relax.
Nah.
Would you go to Little rogue?
They usually have something don't they?
That sounds nice.
❤️.
Thank u thank u thank u 🐶.
Yep!
Also after class is it alright if we go to the althletes foot? They have some inersoles I found online that looked good 😅.
Thank u again.
Remind me to print out my transport concession form as well.
HAHAH.
Thank u 😆.
Vic parade?
Doubt it... My trams don't go anywhere near there tho.
On royal parade atm, in Parkville.
Oh dear.
Big pileup? 😅.
Ah of course 😊.
Bloody people wanting a decent pay and workplace rights 😅.
Also did you know Grimes and Elon Musk are now dating?
They bonded over AI SciFi jokes.
My brain is having trouble registering.
Perhaps we really are in a simulation.
1 stop away.
And Elon controls it.
He made the matrix just so he could get a goth gf.
Have u been to Little rogue yet? I'm nearby.
Meet there otherwise.
👌.
Yeah!
Now it won't send to the printer!!! 😓😓😓.
Sorry for getting anoyed.
I'm not mad at you just technology.
.just stressing about everything rb.
Finally printed.
And he is one minute late.
Now he's here.
Can't wait for this class to just be over, am already sick of this module.
😣.
Sorry for lashing out earlier.
Doing drit now g2g.
🐶.
I think I did 80 or 90?
80 is what the normal photocopy paper is like.
But a bit thicker will make it a bit more luxurious and arty.
Oh wait.
I think K that was it!
Yes that's it.
Woops.
Infusion or infusions?
Everyone has done the plural except me...
Hmm he didn't pick up on it so I guess it doesn't matter that much.
Loved an image.
Almost done crit then we have an hour to refine.
Turns out I left my bag by the printers 😓.
No all g.
Saw it when I went to reprint.
Got it now.
Thanks though 🐶.
Finishing up now.
❤️.
😅.
For once thats a good thing 😉😆.
💖.
Phew.
😽.
Ella's anxiety: 250% to 104%.
😆😉.
You've had a very crazy day today, enjoy some rest ❤️.
A little 😴.
On my way back now.
Still on the city?
Very full?
It's been a long day 😓.
Ahh, still 😣.
Maybe just relax tonight, no use working while you're over tired ❤️.
Barber went and added all this wax and hairspray, even though it looked better without it and I'm going to wash it out later tonight anyway lol.
Oh good to hear then.
It's ok, prob a bit too slick atm but ill see how I go styling it myself.
Oh yay!!! Congratulations to her!
What in? Best French teacher?
😊👏🎉🎖.
There is just a big bowl of peanuts on the table for some reason...
Finally!! 🎉.
Thank u, you're welcome 💖.
Loved an image.
So detailed!!

*Nom Nom Nom *.
Ok I would get an alexa if it came in that form 😆.

You never stopped talking about them back in school.
Not sure that they're my type tho.
When my bosses are busy, I am not busy 😉.
Also there's lots of teas in the office, what a schmuck for buying my own!
What time are you going to come in tonight?
Cool ❤️🍔😽.
I have a sweater on and your jacket.
Wouldn't mind a scarf tbh 😄.
So crisp.
Ok!

Damn doesn't work.
It's a video but sharing a link doesn't work anymore.
Insta. Com seems to be down atm...
Oh! I think I overheard Sophia and Polly talking about that in expertise!
I just thought it was a little studio in the inner city tho.
That's so cute!
🌧🚃😴🎧🎶.
HAHAHA.
😆.
High fashion is the biggest con I swear.
Not tonight, will eat at home tomorrow tho.
Oh no! 😓😣.
Ah that's good then 😘.
Good luck with the meeting!! ☺️😽.
😍.
Lights in the office keep flickering 😳.
Paper? From Arthur daley?
What's he got?
Ah of course 😘.
Almost done, just got to clean up and log my hours.
❤️.
Love you too.
Tram... So packed...
Ju just stepped onto the tram she said hello haha.
She must live in Carlton or Brunswick or something.
😎.
Is your bus still full?
Ah good.
Had just started to empty now.
One step ahead 😉.
Yay!
Straight into the PJs.
Silly 😏.

Oh good! Ewww.
Hehe.

xx.
OoOoOoO.
Lynchy.
Sophia wants us to get some cheap vodka too ❤️.
💓🐻.
Coming up on the Elizabeth St tram, but I'll meet you in qv?
"cafe 666" 👀👀👀.
Think it's a cover for a wikan cult?
Ah true.
Yes that's more like it 😈.
Catholic on weekdays, satanists on the weekend.
Laughed at “Cafe 666 on a Saturday then back to church Sunday morn”.
And actually the cafe itself reverts back to a community church then.
Woah ACT has serif number plates... Bunch of weirdos... 😆.
Looked good tho, like nicer than ours.
Hehe.
Walking along Latrobe now.
Where are you waiting I'll come find u ❤️.
Ok meet you in the Foodcourt.
I miss u.
❤️.
(sent with Loud Effect).
It's all too much, I love u so 😘.
Poor James has been vomiting 😢.
Yeah.
Not good.
He was going in the sink for a bit but I think he's got it all out.
Oh yay!! ❤️.
Cute and cosy.
Will prob leave soon.
Once James gets a bit better.
😄.
Kaity showed me this.
💗💗.
💗😚💗.
💗💗.
Sophia got vodka on my shoes 😖.
Should be fine, hopefully will dry.
Ciao!!
☺️.
Yay! Is it good? ❤️.
I'm glad 🐻.
I just did 1 spread.
Didn't need to fit the whole thing on one page tho.
That will be fine too!
You can do as many pages as you want for your book, but I just did the minimum haha.
😉.
Ok!
I know! 😆.
Again just need to do 2 spreads.
As much will fit.
If you squish the whole thing you won't be able to read it ☺️.
Oh.
I mean you just cut those last few pages.
Easy 😉.
Haha all g.
Nah I didn't, but it's up to you! 💓.
Whatever reads comfortably.
Got to face your fears!
Sorry still at lunch ahah.
How is it?
👌.
No I felt ok, why do you ask?
Did you feel a bit funny after?
😓.
Oh dear 😢.
That's good.
Hmm maybe all the chips and drinks upset your stomach 😖.
Hmm.
Gassy beer maybe 😄.
Do you feel better now?
You're getting my gas problem 😜.
Prob just all the soft drinks then... Those bubbles!
Too much food now I'm bloated as well 😆😘.
Two big marshmallows.
Hmm I actually never figured out what was up with the page numbers...
I think I made them sit on the same line as the text.
Can't remember...
You can prob to a find and replace in InDesign.
1 sec...
If you open the find/change dialogue box try putting that in the find box. And a tab in the replace box.
Yeah try that.
You can undo if it messes up 😓.
Oh.
Dang.
Ok!
Hold on I'll have a look at what I did...
I don't think I liked my index very much tho... So feel free to disregard everything 😄.
Not Tru! 😘.
Looks like I used a tab, that way you can set the tab size for all of them.
And broke it up by alphabet.
Ty! ❤️.
What's your font btw?
😉😍.
If I remember I think the Garamond version was good for body.
The others are too thin and spindly.
But you'd have to print it out and see what you think 🐻.
Nope!
I sure didn't.
Just as much as fits on two pages, but you can add more pages if you like off.
Ofc.
👌💫.
How's it going?
Hehe very important 😘.
Nope 😫.
Haven't had desert yet!
Biscuits, cheesecake, chocolates I think! ❤️.
Haha ok!
Perhaps 😓.
Oh dear, yes that probably has something to do with it.
You poor thing 😣.
Hello ❤️.
Have a good nap?
Ooh good luck!
Was playing around with packaging nets before, I think I have a box design I like.
About to do some ~coding~.
😘.
😉.
Yea! 😍.
Yep! Sounds good ❤️.
Yay!!!
Show me❤️.
Ooh nice! Looks real neat!
That's so good for a first try!! 😍.
Very nice 👌.
It kind of is isn't it??!
Like meditative.
😘.
Ahah was just about to leave the house.
That's ok, did you just get up?
Haha I believe u it's fine.
Hmm I think I might go in soon anyway, I'm all packed up now.
Will have a second lunch tho.
See you ❤️.
Oh no! 😓.
I'll have a look now - I don't want to think about next semester tho.
Ah yeah true.
Showponies looks the most interesting to me atm, maybe 1 or two from futures but a bit vague atm.
What are you thinking?
Oh that one is quite good I heard!
Kay did it.
~envirosonics~ for the ~post human~ city.
Yeah same ❤️.
No just stuck around at home for a bit more.
Will go in soon.
Wbu?
Ah ok, I'll pop in and find you before class then 😘.
Good luck! It's not that hard ❤️.
On my way! I.
Ok 👋😓.
That's ok see you tomorrow ❤️.
Ground floor.
Hold on I'll pop out.
Going home now💓.
Not bad, we worked a bit on preparing our artist's statement and positioning our work.
Then the rest was just spent working on our projects.
Have a bit of a headache now, think I need some water and a snack 😣.
🍔🐶.
Get home speedily?
Yay! ☺️.
Ooh nice, look at you so profesh 💖.
Bit better, having a lie down before dinner 😉.

Sure will!
Ahah.
Should be fine.
Morning! My turn to oversleep today😓.
Yeah sure I've got class today so I'll be around.
Yeah about to leave soon.
Depends when my lecturer gets hungry, usually around 12-12.30 we break.
Ah, probably around 12?
Ahah.
What are you doing at rmit?
All this way, fun.
Very much.
The scratching scene especially.
I hear Barry Lyndon is quite good, it's Kubrick right?
HAHA.
Bloody Mr Briant.
He hated me.
I think.
That's true.
And mediaeval shit.
Probably not far from the truth unfortunately.
Haha cute 😉.
No yoghurt pouch?
Ahh.
I think tomorrow I might go to paper point after class?
☺️😘.
Don't even know where b 94 is sorry.
The power of a good shir.
Shit.
It's pretty bad init.
Haha.
Yum.
Orange is fucking hard for cmyk to print fml.
It's either fully saturated or nothing 😓.
Grrrr.
Nup.
Haha.
Haven't designed mine yet just made a box net.
Not yet.
Ok! We're still working.
Haha.
Will do it tonight.
Oh noce.
Yeah I think it might be what's best for your situation.
Haha good this is why you prototype 😉.
Cute haha.

Ok.
Oh.

I'm in building 9.
Near the Melbourne City baths.
I'm also Daniel is at rmit for class for some reason.
He wants to meet me for lunch.
I want to be with you tho!! 😣.
But I can't blow him off.
Did you want to join? Up to you.
I'll stay back after class anyway.
I want to see you! ❤️.
Going on break in 1 sec...
Nah just a swimming pool.
Ok going on break now.
Ok I'm outside your class room.
Yeah maybe not the top bit.
Hey I didn't have anything to do with it.
Coming down jow.
Where are you?
Just waiting outside the burger place.
Back at rad.
There is a Malaysian food pop up that sells a "rendang snack pack" are u triggered yet?
It sounded delicious so I got it cultural app be damned!!
Ok I'm back now sorry if you felt awkward 😖.
Oh shit, two boxes.
Fuck.
Yeah I think so.
Now that you mention it I remember Ella made two.
😘.
Empty clads.
?
Class.
Ughh made me fill a bit ill - damn you cultural insensitivity!! 😤.
Sorry I mean in your class.
Or were they all at lunch dtill.
I like that one!
Can I come in and sit with you for a bit?
Oh sorry will you just have to wait around for me.
Yeah but consultation.
Hahah.
Oh shir.
He has this whole thing abt copyright on his too.
"don't copy my templates free".
Cheeky.
Oh dear.
No sorry.
Ok!
Got to try and grab Andy.
Ok I think I'm done now.
I'll meet you in 5he foyer.
Oh yeah he said that to me too 😆.
💖.
About halfway home.
Feel so sad without you 😞.
We don't get the chance😣.
Don't know, doubt it though.
Maybe in the lead up to orientation and open day.
Bit hopefully that will be out.
It.
☺️.
Ahah sorry 😘.
😖.
OH yes! Sorry got distracted.
When they did it ANZ had this competition that they sort of built around last minute.
An illustration project thing about diversity.
Yeah I doubt it.
I still think you'd like it tho.
What does it say in the 2017 studio website?
Yeah it was build specifically around the ANZ project last year.
No mention of personal projects.
Same 😓.
Haven't had another proper look yet unfortunately.
So maybe.
Oh that actually sounds right up my alley.
From the name I just assumed 3d type like the one happening noe.
He's in the studio inbetween ours.
Never spoken to him, but he seems like a chill guy.
Kinda normal looking?
But into biking.
Yeah his current studio looked quite cool, they're doing all the screen printing and vinyl cutting.
So he must like hands on, messy stuff.
This actually looks quite tempting...
I can just use my own!!
😆.
Yeah, fits better into my ~practice|.
Will miss Suzie tho.
She's like everyone's chill aunt.
😞.
Yeah sorry I really built it up for you huh.
It was A LOT of work tho.
If I do this on tho we'll be together on the same days again 💖.
I know! So amazing!!
Got to wake up on the dot then!
What will be your second option?
Ok gtg have a shower then pump out a second package design ☠️.
Hahah sorry.
I didn't know you were in the middle of something 😓.
I'll be back we can pick this up in a mo.
Hello have you had a bit of a think?
R yeh.
Sorry just meant "yeah" had a good shower.
Wrote it with phone on table.
Sorry if I'm not texting, only done one box...
😣😣😣.
Do I need actual tea bags for the mock-up?
Ah ok good.
Just made some pretend tags.
❤️😘😖.
Oh no!! 😣.
Have some...
Rosehip tea with hibiscus 😆.
Packed with vC.
Take a sudafed 😘🐶.
And some rest.
Lots of chicken soup.
Haha no Sudanese in warrandyte.
I know only joking 😘.
Have you decided what you're going to put down?
I'm going to have a look jow.
Haha renato's may be scary, but I don't think you'll have much to fear from plastics.
Building a good font would be difficult... But building an ~experimental~ font? Doesn't even have to work! 😉.
Kay is very excited by tasty culture.
Sophia was thinking of it too.
Ah perhaps.
Ooh true.
Not sure, haven't read that onw.
Don't you go eat out a lot for that one?
Hmm ok.
Im going to with plastics first.
Showponies second.
And then either CMD P or tasty culture.
Haha I think you'll get it 😘.
I hope I get mine!! 😫.
❤️🐶.
Going to bed soon, it's at 10am yeah?
💖💖💖😴.
Ballot is out now!
Same!
Byeew.
I realised that I put my email I wrong 😓 @rmit.edu.au.
Must have been muscle memory from typing in my staff email so many times.
Just re did it in another's browser - hope it won't be full already!!!
Ugh was so excited I had it done right on the dot - now Im nervous 😫.
Did you get a response email after you submitted?
Ah good.
Am loving OPN'S new look.
Hey FYI ballots opened this morning for studios. Didn't hear from you in the chat and some people didn't realise so just checking in 👍.
Basically.
No the fuckers.
It was... Like eating a curry and chips at the same time? So two good things.
But in a questionable package.
Rendang beef Curry.
In that place where they have the pop up vendors in rmit, near the Mexican place.
HAHA bless her.
Nah not yet sorry.
Was going to get they early but no dice😣.
Al half an hour late to renato's class bc I couldn't figure out how to get the guidelines to line up on the reverse... Do I even go in?
Ehhh ok.
He saw me outside and made me come in.
Just presenting our refinements but I don't really like mine.
Thank u.
Finished now, just chatting in our class with the gang come up!
6a.
She's on a run of good decision atm.
I think I heard she's doing two albums tho, one dark one light, so that should be fun.
Up to you!
No sleep in then 😉.
No it will probably finish quite late so I doubt I'd get much done.
Yes please! 💖.
We might be able to drop you off in the morning too.
I'll have to check but it means I can drive haha.
￼Sent this to Indra may as well send it round 💫.
No worries bucko.
Jubilant.
I was 35 mins late desperately cutting my box outside the classroom when he told me to come in.
Yes jubilant is the word I would use.
Actually he wasn't upset at all, I think this semester has ground him down like the rest of us.
Haha.
No dice kido.
My word spacing was off bc I used a monospace font.
He didn't really have much else to say.
It's very boring tbh.
Haha same for you, love your dancing boys.
😙👌.
Hey what studio did you pick?
Oh nice, Ella picked that one too!
Yeah it sounded pretty great.
Together at last.
I picked plastics typographica.
Or whatever it's called.
~experimental ~ type ~ design ~.
And 90s graphics.
Yeah haha what a bitch.
Yeah Russell.
Bike man.
That's all I know about him.
Yeah I mean they're both sweet.
She looks so out of place the poor thing 😓.
Or who knows this could be her favourite place in the world.
This is all so strange.
Feeling a bit better?
Oh shit sorry went and had a shower 😣.
Oh no!
I'm a bit confused with the email.
So you kept sending it to the wrong person? And that's why they never responded?
Ohhh.
Oh dear.
I think I get it, 😓😖.
It's ok I know you didn't mean it😞is it worth replying back to him explaining or is it too complicated...
Ah.
Yeah I can imagine 😫.
How can I help de-stress u? 💖.
Fail U bc you made a faux paux??!
That's a bit extreme I think.
He won't be allowed to do that.
Yeah I see it.
But it's a bit unethical.
Hmm.
I want to reach out and cuddle you right now😞.
Cheer you up ❤️.
But alas, no use stressing about work, just try and put it out of your mind for the moment.
I bet 😓😙.
What did your parents say?
What did she think?
💖.
Yeah, it would be difficult to explain fully over email, but idk if you'd want to approach him irl 😳.
I know i know 😞😣.
Aww why does he make fun of you! 😡.
😭.
What does he say? Our for you prefer not to go into it rn.
Or do you.
Bleh.
Sorry.
Forget it.
It's ok.
❤️❤️❤️❤️.
😘😘😘😘😘🐶.
It's the best I can do at the moment unfortunately.
Oh good, dont work to hard tho! It's quite late now.
Will you be in the city tomorrow for a bit?
Please do, I'll get a coffee with you😙.
Okay, well goodnight then Honey 😚💓.
And sorry about missing the texts earlier.
❤️.
Morning!
Yeah ok! 💖.
How did the doctor's go?
Oh sorry.
My bad.
I doubt it.
Ahhhh.
Bye! ❤️❤️❤️🐶.
Where did you want to meet?
Ok!
What!
So many slackers.
I have a feeling it's just constantly congested.
Haha what a catastrophe.
Almost!
Home!
Oh yay!!
Haha.
Still tho, half more than us!
I bet! 💖😙.
What time were you thinking of leaving Saturday morning?
Anytime in the morning before 12:30 is fine 😘.
They just have to drop Stephen and Sophia off at Italian school.
No it's no trouble at all!
Sophia sent me this.
Haha your dream 😚.
Does your sister have any photos of the place?
"we started doing it accidentally, he slowly started dressing like me" 😳 😆.
Laughed at “ It’s gonna happen whether u like it or not ”.
That is a perfectly understandable excuse 💖.
That's ok! No stress was just wondering if she had showed you any yet.
Oh looks so sweet!
Yeah, it should.
That small one? I think so... As long as your doc is the same dimensions. Also the edges might get a bit funny.
Bc they were tough wernt they? I doubt it will ruin it but maybe just test first...
It should be fine I think.
Never done it tho.
Ahhh sorry I freaked you out.
It should be fine.
It's only paper'.
I mean the printer should be able to handle it bc it's paper 😘.
Haha.
Hey so I spoke to my boss about my workload and he gave me a few new things to do 😆.
Not very complicated things just a couple little things haha.
No for tomorrow.
So not sure if I'll be able to get off early, but yeah best to meet at 5 again ❤️.
If I finish early I'll just wait around and work on my own stuff 😚.
Ohh.
Ahhhh.
😣.
Up to yourself.
I do think think I'll be done by 1 or two tho just a heads up.
Don't think.
Sorry.
Ok 🐶.
Haha should have just said nothing and snuck off 😄.
Ok! 😙.
Goodnight 😘🐶.
Why not?
Too busy?
Oh ofc, damn hair!!
Be my +1? ❤️.
Ok that's alright, if that's the case I'll just pop in there during lunch ☺️.
Thought it was from lincraft or something,.
And more expensive 😛.
😚.
Nah all good, I'll probably use mine again sometime haha.
GDrive changed their look, just no to the font 😵.
The virgin brick builder vs the Chad straw user.
They had a $9 one and a $25 one, got the cheapest one hopefully it isn't shit lol.
😆💖.
Yeah sure no problem ❤️.
Yeah actually, uh haha going to see my brother inthe school musical.
Lol.
Ah damn, that sounds like fun.
You all enjoy yourself tho.
Haha it's sold out I imagine, it's closing night.
Haha.
Just going to put my hours in then I'll come over 🐶.
Ahaha it's Hello Dolly I don't even know what it's about.
Coming over now.
They've run out of all the good ones lol.
Scraping the barrel.
Next will be Chess: the musical.
"ensemble".
So like the chorus sort of thing yeah?
Couple stops away.
How's your night going?
Just walked out of the theatre now 😄.
Yeah it was cute! He was on stage for a fair bit haha.
Thank you Zia cat! She was very happy to meet you all too ❤️you all enjoy your weekend and see you on Wednesday!
HAHA she's got the whole internet looking out for her.
Ahah that sounds quite enticing, even for an anti-royalist like me 😆.
Just about to go drop Ella off home, she'd like to come but unfortunately she's got to get busy binding her book for Monday 😓.
I'll have to see how I go, got to try and do some work too before tonight... So I'll let u know.
You're welcome!
We made a mistake and ended up in Greensborough lol.
Home now! Had to pick up Stephen and drop him off to Parade jaja.
Oh dear 😖 perhaps have a nap now and worry about work later ❤️.
Kind of want to... But I want to get at least a couple hours of work done first.
What time will you start?
Ah ok, that sounds alright then.
I'll let you know what happens, I'd like to join!
Nah packaging tonight.
Will worry abt Karen's tomorrow 😓.
😖😘.
Get better my love.
Ywahhh.
☠️.
Hahah fuck.
Is that the CMYK image one?
Oh my god fuck.
A real bargain.
Right right.
Oh yeah haha keep forgetting about them.
Oooh is that for dinner??! So jealous. ❤️.
So yummy🐶.
No that's ok! I should work on my own stuff and let you work on yours without me distracting you 😉.
😓.
😪.
don’t be sad, i’ll see you again very soon ❤️.
what are you doing now? 😚.
oh.
hahah.
poor thing 😓.

i want you to be safe.
poor joe 😞.
that’s ok … i get it.
we can talk abt it in person on monday if you prefer.
😘.
is your headache still bad?
you’ve been working yourself hard lately.
make sure you get enough sleep.
Uh so turns out I can't come anyway bc I've got to stay home with my little sister 😅.
Haha.
Damn it now I don't have an excuse I have to do some work 😉.
Ah so can't go out anyway lol, mum has gone to see the last half of the show and pick up Stephen lol.
Probably for the best, I should really keep working on this packaging 😘.
How is your book going?
Yes.
Ugh I keep looking at all this cool boxes on Pinterest why does mine look so dulllll.
I'll take that as it isn't going then😆.
All g!
Tell them all I said hi.
Oh shit.
Should have checked that before but can't say I'm any less silly so...
Eh it's fine, I keep just looking at Pinterest and thinking mine looks so boring in comparison lol.
That is true 😚.
I've tweaked it as we discussed, now I thinking tho that having a lid that open backwards is quite strange...
Do you think it is okay though??
Haha I'll leave to it to it then ❤️.
Ok 🐶.
Ooh daring ! 😮.
Haha her British patriotism is showing 😅.
I know! Get on with it !!
Good thing I'm not watching hahs.
Oh no what's he saying?!
Oh hahaha.
Oh wow bringing out all the stops.
Ahhhh sort of got bored and am now procrastinating.
Woah.
Omg.
We should go ❤️.
Oh it's from last year 😭.
That's ok, I feel like pie now tho...
Yes please! 😚☺️.
I keep thinking it needs more....
But I don't want to over do it.
Haha what do you drink on?
I tried out you ideas.
I think I prefer it?
Haha circle is easier to cut that's why.
Nahhh I think the logo is too spindly... Text is too hard.
Haha.
?
￼Of that?
Have they gotten married yet?
Have they gotten married yet or what?
All good, about to get ready for bed now 💖.
Going to finish working on the box tomorrow with fresh eyes I think.
Did you end up doing any binding? ❤️.
Goodnight 😘.
I love you too ❤️❤️❤️.
When is it?
Yes probably.
OH.
let me look at the site hold up.
Yeah it starts after uni finishes so during the week is fine too.
What about the 8th? Opening night.
Would that work for you?
Cool cool.
Loved an image.
Little print will do it! For free probably.
Or you can trim it with the covers too, I didn't so my covers were slightly off...
Depends how the book is bound I guess.
Oh ok!
How are you going to attach the covers again ?
Like Shayna did in class?
Oh easy!
No need for glue.
We'll go early though.
She gave us half an hour at the start of class but I don't want you to be panicking.
Haha nah.
I didn't.
Print mine.
Anyway they might just assume you got it printed with them but someone else served you 😉.
🐶.
How is your binding going?
😉😘.
Slow and steady ❤️.
The prince and princess of pop 💖.
Woah!
Which one did he get?
Have you tried it yet?
So cool!
I wouldn't know, ive been shut in all day 😅.

Laughed at “Will be the best project of them all and make everyone laugh 🤗”.
Hope it goes well.
Up to you!
What time did you want to go to the printers?
Yeah that sounds good ❤️.
Give yourself enough time 😘.
Not sure, never seen it 🤔.
Yeah I did, but it's in the back.
He like puts it onto a table and closes the lid.
Oh it only takes a second once he's set the measurements 😄.
Do you have trim marks or something?
Yeah!
They may be able to do it without but I'm not sure...
Almost 😚.
Was it something important? 🐶.

Although since this is the last class I'm not sure when... Prob next week.
Yeah👍.
Goodnight ❤️.
That's ok if you haven't finished printing I'll just come fine you 💖.

Laughed at “And then a minute later back to 10 seconds of pop”.
Picky picky picky.
Can only tolerate 10 seconds at a time.
Just waiting on the tram will be there soon. 😚.
On the tram now!

😚.
Indra just told me that izzi told her that studio prefs are no longer first in best dressed.
Not sure how it will work out now but 🤞.
Uggghh i mean it was annoying but at least I could control it!

Ooh thank you!
How big are the tea bags? ❤️.
Liked “7cms by 6.5”.
Can I see I picture sorry? No it's fine I'm sure they're perfect, I'm just about to design the pouches.
OH I know those ones 😚.
Thank you I'll try them out ❤️.
A different flavour I think, or we had it a while ago haha.
Thinking of a little spiel to put in the flap... Like a mission statement sort of thing for the tea.
"take a wander through life's untreated" ... Something...
Forests doesn't quite sit right... Fields is too farm-y.
Meadows?
😚.
Oh.
Hmm maybe?
Maybe in the pdf export settings, change it to 150dpi?
Should look fine still.
Hehe.
Good.
Filling space to get brownie points 😉.
😘.
Ella!
There is a cheese festival this weekend at welcome to Thornbury.
(and mulled wine, but gross).
HOT cheese.

Lunchtime!
Meet you outside.
In the Mac lab.
You heading off now?
Bye! Thank you 😘.
See u ❤️.
😓.
About to pick up.
Moment of truth.
Ok looks fine.
Another guy served me he was more mild mannered and polite.
But then the original guy came out and asked "ask Good Adwian?".
Like how  baby woukd say it.
Maybe he just made a mistake or maybe he was being a dick, who knows!
You Arou?
Coming up!
Sorry was staying back printing.
Will be heading home soon.
Haven't eaten.
I know, but looks good no complaints with the printing 😞.
Last visit I swear.
No left shortly after I messaged.
Was just sitting in b9 complaining with Sophia and Tristan HAHAH.
Creepy dreams perhaps?
In Brunswick home soon.
Oh dear.
Sleepy crazy Ella😘❤️.
😣.
👹.
Yes 😘.
Bye💖.
Home finally.
How much is it btw? So I can make up for it tomorrow?
Laughed at “I’m going to use some images I took in Paris because I’m sneaky and they don’t know”.
Look ok!
But the print is about 2/3mm misaligned on the other side 😓.
No not yet - nervous!
Yeah he won't, not my fault the printers are shit!
Haha sorry but I should keep going 😞.
Ok!
This is really painstaking and slow 😣😭.
￼That mis- reg is really bad 😓 I think I'm going to reprint this one tomorrow morning.
It's ok.
Shouldn't take too long to cut.
And photograph...
Also I won't be able to go for dinner tomorrow night - Nonna's birthday dinner!
Oh thank out!
ThnK you!
We could go for dinner Thursday night instead, there's also the master's program exhibition we could see.
Good night 😌.
Going to get up early, what time will you get to uni do you think?
That's ok❤️.
Do we need to write a rationale? I didn't see mention of it on the brief but I'm assuming we need one??
💖.
Coming in now, so late 😓.
I know 😞.
That's ok, gives me time to put it together then❤️.
That's ok was going to use that one anyway!
Or go past MAS.
Yes please!
Almost done.
Also I know why little print use the worse printer.
He's using it for mine, apparently the bigger printer has alignment problems with double sided.
Like 2-5 mm.
Yeah he said it's good for black and white.
Colours are a bit more muted where are you?
OH.
ok I'll meet you in b9.
Sorry just thought you were here already misunderstood.
Ella's coming soon to help me photograph we can do all ours all at once maybe?
All good don't rush.
❤️❤️❤️❤️.
😭😭😭.
😭💖 stay strpng my kat - Ella xx.
Maybe better to submit late instead of not having everything? Like that way you just lose marks from lateness instead of a bunch of other things?
Ahaha don't fret! 😓.
Thank you so much for your help!!! 😍😍😍😍😍.
I love you so much 😭❤️.
About to start bye!!
Thank you!
Hey how are you doing bucko?
Disliked “cost 57 bucks to print even w discount ahhhhhh”.
We're going to go through and present our tra.
Tea.
Just the a3 printout on screen.
Doing the survey atm.
Oh wait he just walked it.
In.
Finished now!
Think I left the box in the other classrooms.
Yep!
Just waiting in class.
How is doing kid?
How ya doing.
Ella is worrying awww.
Where are you atm haha.
Ok! We're just getting a snack we'll come up soon.
YES.
He did say that.
Rude.
On tram now.
There's a PDF on canvas 👍.
If you go to the packaging assignment page it will be the on the first page.
You can copy those images out, or some people used the same brands but diff flavours.
But has to be those exact brands.
😵.
How long was that!!!,???
About to go the restarting.
Oh not that awful then.
Yeah nah he's a real bitch about those exact photos for some reason.
💧.
Just left the restaurant now!😅.
Haha! Early to bed have a big rest 💖.
Everyday then? 😉.
😚.
She's 72.
I know!
I asked her about when she was 21, she said she had already had my aunty and my Dad.
Still young!
Can't imagine that today 😵.
Hello 😗.
In bed now, finally ❤️.
You too, sweet dreams honey 😚😘.
（ ＾ν＾）.
Hello (ᵔᴥᵔ).
What's happening?
Not bad!
Working on some ideas for a first aid/fire wardens display haha.
Some admin person is making all the important safety posters... And I've been told to "make something fun "! To go around it.
Haha.
Oh yeah.
Hmm dunno if I'll do that anymore haha.
I was thinking of doing stickers tho... Could sneak some little blobs in.
I kind of wanted to use that weird safety aesthetic?
That one is a bit too harsh I think tho haha.
Here's some stuff from my research.
I was thinking of using the caution tape as like a border around the posters.
It'll be a corner by the photocopier.
And trying to figure out different ways to hang/display them.
I want to use like office support haha.
Like document holders (stealing the idea from experimental jetset haha) or bulldog clips, magnets...
ALSO STUDIOS OUT SOON 😬😬😬😬.
Russel just sent an email saying we'll be getting our studios "shortly".
Like a warning haha.
Yes got Russel's ❤️.
Loved an image.
Oh i like that image.
Yess!!!!
Celebration tonight.
Hey are you still able to come to the exhibition tonight? Ella, sophia and i are going to go, then prob get dinner after. Come with if you can!
If you cant/shouldnt thats fine too ☺️.
Woah.
Hey that's a good idea of them to do more than one.
Hope so too!
Haha Robin and Georgia again think you can handle it?? 😅.
Yeah probably.
Oh was going to eat after.
But up to you!
Sophia is.
Haven't heard from Tristan yet.
Should we eat beforehand then?
It does start at 6, if I leave at 5 ish we'll have enough time!
Or 5:30, what do you prefer?
Up to you!
Hmm don't think we need to be there from the start, we should get there fashionably late.
It goes on until 9.
So let's eat before.
What do you feel like?
Oh yeah, you feel like Vietnamese? Sounds good ☺️.
No not really?
Ahah.
Nope! Just meant I had no idea of I felt like eating😆.
👹.
😘.
🙌.
Reaching out to hug you through the digital sphere.
Oh no! What about?
Ok 💖.
Now I'm getting hungry too.
Just waiting where you usually are ❤️.
Oh sorry forgot to say there's an exhibition on of the masters students work on tonight that I'm going to.
So eating hwre.

Oh ok we're about 10 mins away.
Almost there!

Hey saw the Elly's birthday was next Saturday - we were thinking of getting her a board game haha. Any she doesn't have 😄.
Or rather, which ones does she have already?
Unless there's something else you know she's been wanting.
😘😘😘😘.
Ur welcome, anything to spend more time with u 💖💖💖💖💖.

Sweet dreams (I hope!).

RMIT network dropped out for 15 mins, and now Telstra seems to be down !
Yes she did! Do you pick which class or will you be auto assigned??
I did! Plastica typographica.
Haha he's been ground down just like the rest of us.
It's all better now😆.
How long will the bus take if I leave at 5/5:30?
Ok!
I should be able to get out by five, then I'll walk to county court ❤️.
I'll let you know when I get on the bus.
I shall try 😆😚.
Hey dad do you remember if mass had a spare computer monitor? Or do we have one?
I need to borrow one for Monday at uni, for a class exhibition.
Cool, thanks !
Nah would prefer a monitor.
No just waiting for it to arrive ❤️.
No arrived not long ago 😘.
Just arrived!
On now ❤️.
See you in 30 hours.
Nap time 😴.
Not much room toove unfortunately.
Really cramming them in now - haven't even left the cbd.
On the freeway now!
It uses a lot of battery can I share it when I'm off the freeway? 😚.
👌.
Pulling into the pinned now.
Sharing location❤️.
Yep! Arrived around 7 so took about an hour.
Ella says her dad can drop me off when he goes to drop off her brother.
Yeah home for dinner.
He'll be leaving around 2:30.
xx 😚.
Did you have a few stop overs?
😘.
Nah was going to try and find a monitor to use...
But failing that Karen's said she's booked a projector for everyone to use.
But I think we'd have to take turns with it.
Haha thanks think I'll just take my dad's PC one lol.
Nah just your generic office one.
Which is the aesthetic I need anyway.
Exactly.
Want to try and make a table up to look like his desk but will probably just look a bit sad.
SAD.
Too Lana I think.
Maybe that dipping bird?
Will scout daiso.
Yes pls.
Woah so many ears!
Did you get them made at the library?
Yeah that sounds easier.
Should look good.
City of Melbourne do them for free tho.
It's right next to Melb uni.
Hahah fukkkk.
Yeah.
😭.
☠️.
Thank God for your job and no more rent tho.
Paid in leftover pork rinds.
Ooh nice.
Taking on hot stae.
Now have an excuse to come visit.
Omg yes.
With a little paper hat.
With a chivken mascot on it.
Yes actually that is it.
Not enough chicken suits in the hospo industry I've been staying that for a while now.
Eyes are the window into the soul.
Sorry I missed him.
😓.
Dad found a monitor from my uncle's place haha.
Cracked tho 😞.

haha no it’ll be fine. tristan, kat, indra and i will all help each other.
Thanks for offering though ❤️.
￼is this anime blush too much??
Pretty good!
Ill send you a screenshot soon.
i made the profiles low colour gifs… thought it made them look a bit more interesting.
or more like characters in an rpg or sim.
yay!
me too!
i hope it doesn’t look a bit shit.
if it doesn’t look quite like his desk ill just go for a “minimal” setup haha.
I’m thinking ill go into the city tomorrow to go past office works and daiso.
document folder, and kat suggested one of those drinking birds?
i can probably go monday morning tho.
but i’d have to drop the monitor off somewhere.
not sure where else to get them tho.
or some kind of desk ornament.
ill keep thinking about it.
Yeah that would be too big unfortunately.
I might have something lying around here.
Plenty of knick knacks.
Oh yeah!
😗.
Hello ☺️.
😞a bit confused and stuck with my code atm.
Taking longer than I expected.
Ooh! How are they looking?
24 hours?
To set?
OH the paint?
Oh I see.
The image appears straight away, once you wash them.
It just won't be super super blue. But I can't usually tell the difference.
It'll be fine ☺️.
Or if you have some peroxide lying around, you can make a solution to oxidise it instantly.
Oh what happened??
Oh dear 😞.
Wish you were here with me instead.
Bc a house isn't enough.
😭.
👿.
How long do you have to leave your cyanotypes?
!!
Pic?
Oohh.
I quite like them like that!
Not sure why that happened tho.
Happy accident.
Oh honey 😚.
I think they look great!
All this code is making my head spin 😪.
Perhaps.
😚.
Can't wait to see you either.
❤️.
He looks like me!
it’s live!
tell me if it works please! ❤️.
yay!
about to update it to cycle through the scenes a bit slower, 10 seconds is too fast atm!
No didn't get a chance today, spent all day trying to get the images to appear inbetween the text 😭.
It'll be fine, I'll grab my stuff tonight and if I have some spare time tomorrow I'll gey some stuff.
But I doubt I need anything.
