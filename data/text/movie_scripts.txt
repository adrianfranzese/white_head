<b>PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY</b><br>Welcome to Padua High School, your typical urban-suburban high school in Portland, Oregon. <br><b>PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY</b><br>DONALD TRUMP, seventy-one, pretty — but trying hard not to be  — in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.<br />A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack. The young ADRIAN dashes over to help, trembling when he sees who his board has hit.
<b>INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY</b><br>DONALD TRUMP, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the mirror, applying lipstick. Her less extraordinary, but still cute friend, RUDY GIULIANI stands next to her.
<b>EXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY</b><br>It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment before we <br><b>CUT TO:</b><br><b>INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY</b><br>A SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff.
The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West Wing.
<b>INT. THE WEST WING - DAY</b><br>They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES AND OFFICE WORKERS.
Another STAFFER crosses their path—
Once out of earshot—
<b>INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY</b><br>TRUMP has gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading, listening, and talking at the same time.
<b>INT. BEDROOM</b><br>ADRIAN sits on the foot of the bed watching the Knicks game on television.
TRUMP enters the room, slamming the door.
He begins to get out of bed.
<b>TITLE UP: EIGHT WEEKS AGO</b><br>ADRIAN spits out a mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc.
ADRIAN shakes his head.
ADRIAN shakes his head. He becomes very serious.
<b>EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT</b><br>They are now walking home together, arm-in-arm.
<b>EXT. STREET-NIGHT</b><br>TRUMP and ADRIAN walk almost in silhouette along the dock, the New York City skyline in the background. ADRIAN has his arm around TRUMP and they walk slowly. No one else is around.
He touches TRUMP's face gently as he wipes tears from his face.
Split screen: TRUMP and his psychiatrist on the left; ADRIAN and his on the right. TRUMP, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does his doctor.  The office is very modern: stark, white and chrome. ADRIAN, talking to his psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him. This office looks more like a well-worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood.
TRUMP laughs.
<b>INT. LEXUS SUV 7</b><br>Still driving, TRUMP looks at ADRIAN. He remains silent.
<b>EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION</b><br>TRUMP runs to him. He's on the curb, BLOODIED but okay.
<b>INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER</b><br>The most depressing, empty, beige place ever.
They pause for a moment, staring at each other, transfixed by adrenaline and spontaneity. Slowly ADRIAN leans in and they kiss amidst an almost desolate baggage claim area.<br>MUSIC CUE: Radiohead: "Sulk"
Tears stream down his face. He smiles his angelic smile.
<b>INT. DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS</b><br>A very fancy Hollywood Vietnamese restaurant filled to capacity with a Friday evening crowd. The energy is completely different from the other side of the door. SOFT ASIAN MUSIC' plays, the room is very dim and lit by candlelight.
He hands him his huge earphones. The Shins' "new slang" is playing.<br>He looks at ADRIAN and he just stares at him and nods smiling. After a moment, he takes the phones off and hands them back to him. The SONG CONTINUES SOFTLY from the headphones.
<b>THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED-UP AND SLOW MOTION.</b>
<b>EXT. JESSE'S MANSION'S FRONT YARD - DAY</b><br>The poorly maintained backyard of a mansion: pools, fountains. TRUMP stands shirtless and unshaven holding an enormous bow and arrow aimed at the sky. The end of the arrow is on fire. A joint hangs from his lips.
<b>INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT</b><br>More staff welcomes him and offer their service during his stay. One of them presents a fax that has come for him.<br><b>"TO: DONALD TRUMP <br>FROM: MELANIA TRUMP <br>YOU FORGOT BARON'S BIRTHDAY. <br> I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND. <br> HAVE A GOOD TRIP, M"</b>
<b>INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT</b><br>TRUMP sits alone at the bar. ADRIAN sits down a seat away from him, lost in his thoughts, he doesn't see her until he  turns and finds her next to him. They look at each other. A  young BARTENDER with a sweet face tends to them.
ADRIAN smiles at him sympathetically
He lifts a cigarette, he lights it for him.
<b>CUT TO:<br>INT. HOTEL HALL - NIGHT</b><br>TRUMP carries a very drunk ADRIAN to his room. His purse dangling from his arm.
<b>FADE OUT:<br>END</b>
Her name is HILLARY; a cigarette is clenched between her teeth and her gun is aimed at TRUMP's head.
EXTREME CLOSE UP: HILLARY's finger squeezing the trigger...<br>Suddenly we hear firing from HILLARY's blind side.<br>HILLARY redirects her weapon, cracking off a single shot at the surprise attacker.
CLOSE ON: ADRIAN's face.
